    "nb": "This article concerns coping strategies of workers subjected to workplace bullying. First, it compares the development of the bullying process with various models of conflict escalation. Next, it presents the review of literature on the responses of employees exposed to bullying to negative workplace activities. Finally, it describes the results of studies comparing targets’ and non-targets’ strategies on various stages of bullying development. The indings indicate that employees previously exposed to bullying at the very early stage of conflict respond in a way that may be\r\ninterpreted as unconstructive, while those who encounter single conflicts intensify their endeavors to make a good impression and try to gain social support from their\r\nsurrounding interpersonal relationships. When the conflict is severe and difficult to solve, targets of bullying seek support and use strategies based on cooperation. The article concludes with directions for future studies to identify strategies for prevention programs."

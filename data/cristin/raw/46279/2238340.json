    "en": "How sexual harassment (SH) is understood and intervened against in the police? SH is an intersectional phenomenon. Different forms of social inequality, oppression and discrimination interact in it and potentially hinder the development of a safe, inclusive and sustainable working life for police employees and others.  Sexual harassment is approached in UISH from three perspectives: (1) bystanders, (2) harassed/exposed, and (3) harassers.\r\n\r\nThe ‘bystander perspective’ (1) build upon the fact that most cases of SH (e.g., slurs, humour, and verbal comments) occur in a work group. The ‘harassed and exposed perspective’ (2) is based on already existing studies documenting intersectional differences (e.g., gender) in perceived and actual acts of SH within the police. UISH aims at developing “in-group forum” initiative to prevent and intervene against SH as well as mapping practices of receptivity and resistance to SH initiatives. The ‘perpetrator perspective’ (3) covers those who harass and expose others to harassment, as well as the human and structural factors enabling harassment and placing different levels of risk based on for instance age, gender, race, sexual orientation, and position on different employees in the police. Designing research with ‘perpetrator perspective’ is methodologically challenging."

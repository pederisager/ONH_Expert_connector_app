    "en": "Whistleblowing is when a former or current employee discloses misconduct that is under their employers control to someone that may be able to do something about it. Whistleblowing is empirically related to workplace bullying, but the causal direction of the association is still unclear. To determine the nature of the direction between whistleblowing and bullying, this study investigates the relationship between the variables with three measurement points, employing a representative sample of Norwegian employees."

    "en": "Police officers, like other professionals, need to develop their competence and skills in correspondence with society. Peer feedback has been proven to significantly affect learning in the educational setting, and colleagues are seen as significant for the learning process in organizations. However, there seems to be little systematic knowledge concerning how verbal peer feedback affects police officers in workplace learning programs, and which elements affect this feedback. This review aims to fill this gap by analyzing 20 studies selected based on Arksey & O’Malley’s methodological framework. Findings show that police officers’ performance, motivation, and job satisfaction effectively can be improved using verbal peer feedback. It also shows some workplace conditions and factors management, and feedback actors should consider when organizing for and conducting feedback. Lastly, it shows that much of the research conducted within the educational sector also is valid for police workplace learning programs. However, further research is needed, especially concerning the relationship between police peers."

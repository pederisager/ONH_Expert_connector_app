    "en": "The rise in complexity and severity of crime calls for innovations in investigative approachesin law enforcement. Ideally, investigation plans (I-plans) are an important improvement inprocedural standards and hypothesis-driven methodology that ensures improved clear-uprates, notoriety of evidence and, ultimately, the legal rights of all actors involved. But thesepotentials are only realised if the expressed ideal behind the I-plan is put into practice. Basedon Knutsen’s (2020) critical examination of investigators’ reasoning of the use of I-plans inpractice, where Hartmann and Bjørkelo acted as supervisors, we question to what extent I-plans areactuallybeing used as intended or are at risk of becoming ‘The Emperor’s NewClothes’. After contextualising the expressed goals and intentions behind the implementa-tion of the I-plan, in the Norwegian Police Service (NPS), we present the study’s key insightsand implications for future consideration."

  "summary": {
    "en": "Whistleblowing is a situation in which an employee reports mismanagement or mistreatment to an organizational member that is able to do something about it (cf. Near & Miceli, 1985). Studies have shown that reporting misconduct can be followed by retaliation (e.g., ostracism and selective downsizing, Near & Miceli, 1986) as well as workplace bullying (Bjørkelo, Ryberg, Matthiesen, & Einarsen, 2008). This viewpoint paper presents directions for future research by linking the academic fields of workplace bullying and whistleblowing together. The paper also reports both practical and clinical implications in terms of dealing with the health consequences that sometimes arise in the wake of such workplace experiences."

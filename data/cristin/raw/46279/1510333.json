  "summary": {
    "nb": "This in-depth study investigates and discusses how police leaders lead and handle learning from experience. This is done by going into actual cases where police employees are suspected of committing criminal offences on duty and the Norwegian Bureau for the Investigation of Police Affairs (the Bureau) decides not to prosecute, but still requests of police leaders to address the issue. Based on actual cases, our findings show that police leaders interpret the Bureau’s request as an invite to look into one’s current practice. Still, the way the leaders lead learning from experience in these cases mainly takes the form of “straightening up” practice through instrumental learning measures, i.e., based on the criminal law. The findings also points towards that learning from actual cases, may require leading through opening up for reflection and dialogue concerning the question “is this good police work?”. The main findings are discussed in relation to what may be viewed as conditions for learning of experience."

    "en": "Whistleblowing is when an employee or worker reports misconduct, such as fraud or the harassment of a colleague, to someone who is able to do something about it inside or outside his or her workplace (cf. Near & Miceli, 1985). While many studies on whistleblowing have been conducted in North America and other parts of the world (see e.g., Bjørkelo, Ryberg, Matthiesen, & Einarsen, 2008; Brown, 2008; Lewis & Trygstad, 2009; Miceli, Near, & Dworkin, 2008; Park & Blenkinsopp, 2009; Uys, 2008), only some few have investigated whistleblowing in India (cf. Patel, 2003) and even fewer Indian researchers themselves. This article describes the whistleblowing phenomenon, some studies on the likelihood of reporting wrongdoing in India and suggests some ways to start research on employees and workers who actually report wrongdoing in Indian workplaces."

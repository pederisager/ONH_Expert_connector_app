    "en": "To compare visceral adipose tissue (VAT) mass, lipid profile, and selected adipokines/cytokines in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) with controls, and to explore associations between these markers and VAT. We included 60 JIA patients (30 oligoarticular,30 polyarticular), aged 10–16 years, and 60 age-and sex-matched controls. VAT (g) was estimated by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Lipid profile and selected adipokines/cytokines were analyzed by standard methods and ELISA, respectively. VAT (g) was comparable between patients and controls [median (25th-75th percentile): 64 (23–149) g vs. 66 (30–99) g, p = 0.98] and between oligoarticular and polyarticular disease courses [46 (22–123) g vs. 80 (23–167) g, p = 0.32]. Patients had lower serum levels of apolipoprotein A1 (APOA1) and elevated levels of interleukin- 6 (IL-6) and progranulin compared to controls. As compared to oligoarticular disease course, patients with polyarticular disease had lower serum levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)), interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) and progranulin, and elevated levels of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1b) and IL-1b/IL-1RA ratio. In patients (B, 95% CI), higher IL-6 (48.7, 25.1 to72.2, p < 0.001), resistin (8.5, 5.1 to 11.8, p < 0.001), and leptin (2.5, 0.9 to 4.0, p = 0.002) were associated with higher VAT. In controls, higher leptin (5.3, 3.7 to 6.9), p < 0.001) was associated with higher VAT. Despite similar VAT mass between patients and controls, VAT was related to IL-6 and resistin in patients only, suggesting an active metabolic role in JIA. Several pro-inflammatory adipokines/cytokines were increased in JIA, with differences in Lp(a) between oligoarticular and polyarticular disease courses."

The purpose of this study was to investigate how kindergarten staff experience working methods, and how knowledge level influenced their food practices and attitudes. Pedagogical leaders from 240 private and municipal Norwegian kindergartens answered the cross-sectional survey. A score of the respondents’ self-reported knowledge on a sustainable diet was calculated. Knowledge of a sustainable diet correlated positively with the respondents’ views on the kindergarten’s responsibility for education on a sustainable diet and eating habits in children. All respondents emphasized the importance of reducing food waste; in most kindergartens, however, the served food did not support a sustainable diet. A majority of respondents reported that children rarely took part in activities to increase their knowledge about food and sustainability. A positive correlation was found between knowledge score and children’s participation in food waste activities, harvesting, and growing, but not cooking. This study shows that pedagogical leaders in Norwegian kindergartens are aware of the opportunities to educate children in sustainable food practices, but the reported implementation was low."

      "en": "Introduction: Marine oils and fatty fish rich in long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), such as eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5n-3, EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6n-3, DHA), have been reported to enhance fatty acid (FA) oxidation and reduce plasma triacylglycerol and cholesterol levels. In addition to n-3 PUFAs, herring oil contains long-chain monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), including cetoleic acid (C22:1n-11). This study aimed to investigate the effect of consuming CETO3® oil—derived from herring and naturally rich in n-3 PUFAs and cetoleic acid—on plasma lipid levels, FA composition, mitochondrial oxidation, and inflammation in rats.\n\nMethods: Rats were fed low-fat diets supplemented with 5% CETO3® oil (experimental) or soy oil (control) for 10 weeks. Plasma lipid profile (triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)) and FA composition in both liver and plasma were analyzed. In vitro substrate oxidation was assessed using ¹⁴CO₂-trapping in human liver and human myotubes. Safety parameters, including blood hematology, glucose tolerance, and organ weights, were also measured.\n\nResults: CETO3® supplementation decreased plasma levels of total fat (−58%), TG (−55%), total cholesterol (−41%), and LDL cholesterol (−45%), while increasing the ratio of HDL to LDL cholesterol (46%). Supplementation also increased hepatic and plasma levels of long-chain n-3, n-9, and n-11 MUFAs, including C22:1n-11, and decreased n-6 FA accumulation. The reduction in saturated long-chain FAs in both the liver and plasma indicated increased hepatic peroxisomal and mitochondrial activity. Furthermore, increased oleic acid oxidation was observed in human myotubes in the presence of C20:1n-11 and C20:1n-9.\n\nDiscussion: These findings suggest that intake of CETO3® oil lowers plasma lipids, potentially through enhanced peroxisomal and mitochondrial FA oxidation. The shift in FA composition, with reduced n-6 FAs and increased n-3 and n-11 MUFAs, indicates an anti-inflammatory effect. CETO3® oil also appears safe, as hematological parameters, glucose tolerance, and organ weights remained unaffected."

In a double-blind, randomized, and crossover study, females (n = 16) and males (n = 23) aged 30–70 years with abdominal obesity were supplemented with 3–4 g/d EPA/DHA (fish oil) or 15–20 g/d LA (safflower oil) for 7 weeks, with a 9-week washout phase. Cytokines and chemokines (multiplex assay), acute-phase proteins (MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry), endothelial function (vascular reaction index), blood pressure, FA composition (red blood cell membranes/serum/adipose tissue, GC-MS/MS), and adipose gene expression (microarrays, quantitative PCR) were measured. While significant differences between treatments in relative change scores were found for systolic blood pressure (n-3 vs. n-6: −1.81% vs. 2.61%, P = 0.003), no differences between n-3 and n-6 were found for any circulatory inflammatory markers. However, compared with baseline, n-3 was followed by reductions in circulating TNF (−24.9%, P < 0.001), regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (−12.1%, P < 0.001), and macrophage inflammatory protein 1-beta (−12.5%, P = 0.014), and n-6 by lowered TNF (−18.8%, P < 0.001), regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (−7.37%, P = 0.027), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (−7.81%, P = 0.020), and macrophage inflammatory protein 1-beta (−14.2%, P = 0.010). Adipose tissue showed significant treatment differences in weight percent of EPA (n-3 vs. n-6: 50.2%∗ vs. −1.38%, P < 0.001, ∗: significant within-treatment change score), DHA (16.0%∗ vs. −3.67%, P < 0.001), and LA (−0.033 vs. 4.91%∗, P < 0.001). Adipose transcriptomics revealed overall downregulation of genes related to inflammatory processes after n-3 and upregulation after n-6, partly correlating with changes in circulatory markers. These data point to tissue-specific proinflammatory effects of high n-6 intake, but a net systemic anti-inflammatory effect as for n-3."

      "en": "Objective:\nPupils’ active involvement in the learning process may be pivotal for effective learning in food education and for connecting learned concepts to health-related behaviours. The objective of this study was to investigate effects of pupil participation on knowledge and satisfaction in the Norwegian school subject Food and Health.\nDesign and setting:\nThirteen classes from one lower secondary school in Western Norway were randomly assigned to two teaching intervention groups, with either moderate or high levels of pupil participation. The topic was seasonal fruit and vegetables. Questionnaires were responded to after 2 weeks and 6 months.\nMethods:\nScores on pupils’ objective knowledge were calculated from multiple-choice and open-ended questions, and self-perceived knowledge and subject satisfaction were measured by Likert-type scale items. Difference between groups was determined using the Student’s t-test.\nResults:\nMultiple-choice scores did not differ between groups, but open-ended question scores were significantly higher in the high pupil participation group compared to the moderate pupil participation group at both 2 weeks and 6 months following the intervention (p = .04). Pupils’ self-perceived knowledge was significantly higher in the high participation group compared to the moderate participation group after 2 weeks, as was pupils’ satisfaction with the lessons (p < .001). Pupils in the high participation group were more confident that they could use what they had learned outside of school (2 weeks, p < .001) and make sustainable food choices (6 months, p = .02).\nConclusion:\nOur findings indicate that level of pupil participation in food education lessons influenced pupils’ objective and self-perceived knowledge, and subject satisfaction. Further studies should investigate possible links to health-related behaviour."

      "en": "Recent educational programs emphasize the concept of pupil participation which entail pupil autonomy during all steps of learning. However, little is known about how this is implemented in practice. The objective of the current study is to investigate how pupil participation is practiced in the Norwegian school subject Food and Health at lower secondary school level. The pupils’ own perception of pupil participation is the focus of the paper. The objective was addressed by a mixed method approach including survey data, observations, and interviews with pupils. Pupil participation was studied in eight areas of the subject, namely 1) shaping the academic content, 2) selecting ingredients and dishes, 3) purchasing and calculating costs of ingredients, 4) preparation for cooking, 5) cooking, 6) distribution of tasks, 7) meal situation, and 8) assessment. The results indicate that pupil participation varies for different parts of the subject, being lowest for shaping the academic content and purchasing and calculating costs, and highest for the meal situation. Overall, the findings indicate that pupil participation is not practiced to the extent that the educational program requires, and future studies needs to shed light on how degree of pupil participation can be increased to achieve the goals in the educational program."

I disse intervjuene har vi fokusert på spørsmål om kommunenes erfaringer knyttet til innføringen og drift av disse ordningene for å undersøke hvordan en gradvis innføring av skolemåltid i Norge kan innrettes på en best mulig måte. Tilbakemeldingene fra kommunene viser at det er stor variasjon i både tidsperspektiv for hvordan-, og i hvilken grad, - ulike interessegrupper ble involvert i planleggingen av de ulike ordningene. Ifølge kommunene selv ble ordningene stort sett godt mottatt av elever og foreldre, men det ble rapportert om til dels stor motstand blant lærere, særlig i kommuner hvor disse ble involvert i gjennomføringen uten å ha bli rådført på forhånd. Det var også til dels stor variasjon i skolemattilbudet hva angikk antall ukentlige måltid, varm eller kald mat og hvor involvert kommunen sentralt var i gjennomføring og oppfølging på de enkelte skolene. Anbefalingene fra kommunene for oppstart av skolematordninger inkluderer blant annet tidlig planlegging og utprøving, god forankring blant interessegrupper, dedikert matfaglig personell til skolematordningen, mulighet for lokale tilpasninger, samt langsiktig forutsigbarhet for alle involverte"

Thirteen home economics classes from one lower secondary school were randomly assigned to each intervention. Pupils answered a questionnaire on objective and subjective knowledge and perceptions on learning two weeks and seven months after the intervention.\r\n\r\nResults: Results showed that multiple choice answers on factual knowledge did not differ between groups. The high pupil participation group demonstrated significantly higher knowledge on budget and received a higher score on open questions compared to the moderate group, both two weeks and seven months after the intervention.\r\n\r\nConclusion: The high pupil participation group agreed more with statements reflecting subjective knowledge, and high pupil participation influenced pupils’ perceptions significantly regarding statements that they learn more when participating in the planning process, and that what they have learned in Food and health affects their ability to make sustainable food choices in the\r\nfuture. Further studies on the effect of pupil participation on other aspects of learning should be performed.\r\n\r\nMain message: The food and health subject is important to convey knowledge and good food practices in pupils.

      "en": "Background and objective Metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is associated with abnormal lipid metabolism. Mitochondrial dysfunction is considered an important factor in the onset of MAFLD, whereas altered fatty acid composition has been linked to the severity of the disease. Tetradecylthioacetic acid (TTA), shown to induce mitochondrial proliferation and alter the fatty acid composition, was used to delay the accumulation of hepatic triacylglycerol. This study aimed to evaluate how impaired mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation affects fatty acid composition by incorporating meldonium into a high-carbohydrate diet. Methods C57BL/6 mice (n = 40) were fed high-carbohydrate diets supplemented with meldonium, TTA, or a combination of meldonium and TTA for 21 days. Lipid levels were determined in liver samples, and fatty acid composition was measured in both liver and plasma samples. Additionally, desaturase and elongase activities were estimated. The hepatic activities and gene expression levels of enzymes involved in fatty acid metabolism were measured in liver samples, whereas carnitines, their precursors, and acylcarnitines were measured in plasma samples. Results The meldonium-induced depletion of L-carnitine and mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation was confirmed by reduced plasma levels of L-carnitine and acylcarnitines. Principal component analyses of the hepatic fatty acid composition revealed clustering dependent on meldonium and TTA. The meldonium-induced increase in hepatic triacylglycerol levels correlated negatively with estimated activities of elongases and was associated with higher estimated activities of delta-6 desaturase (D6D; C18:4n-3/C18:3n-3 and C18:3n-6/C18:2n-6), and increased circulating levels of C18:4n-3 and C18:3n-6 (gamma-linolenic acid). TTA mitigated meldonium-induced triacylglycerol levels by 80% and attenuated the estimated D6D activities, and elongation of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). TTA also attenuated the meldonium-mediated reduction of C24:1n-9 (nervonic acid), possibly by stimulating Elovl5 and increased elongation of erucic acid (C22:1n-9) to nervonic acid. The hepatic levels of nervonic acid and the estimated activity of n-6 PUFA elongation correlated negatively with the hepatic triacylglycerol levels, while the estimated activities of D6D correlated positively.

      "nb": "Denne prosjektevalueringen har sett på elever, foresatte og ansatte sine erfaringer med en gratis skolematordning ved Austrheim skole i Haugesund kommune. I et toårig pilotprosjekt fikk elever fra 1. til 4. trinn et heldags skoletilbud som inkluderte et gratis skolemåltid i felles spisesal. Både sosiale aspekt ved måltidet og elevers matvalg ble evaluert. I tillegg ble eleverfaringer om sosiale aspekt ved måltidet innhentet fra en sammenlignbar kontrollskole med matpakkelunsj i klasserommet.\r\nResultatene viste at elever på 3. og 4. trinn, ansatte og foresatte mente at de felles skolemåltidene bidro til trivsel og fremmet sosiale interaksjoner mellom elever og mellom elever og ansatte ved Austrheim skole. Både elever på Austrheim skole og kontrollskolen var opptatt av sosiale aspekt ved måltidet, men elever ved Austrheim skole følte et høyere nivå av medbestemmelse. Erfaringer fra Austrheim skole viste at for å få et rolig måltid med muligheter for samtaler mellom elever og ansatte, var det viktig å ha nok ansatte til stede. Selv om de ansatte var enig i at skolemåltidet var positivt for skolemiljøet, mente flertallet at det å måtte delta i skolemåltidene førte til en mer strevsom arbeidsdag. Foresatte mente derimot at å slippe å smøre matpakke var en stor hjelp i hverdagen. Elevene var mest fornøyd med varmmåltidene, som ble servert to-tre ganger i uken, men likte også godt å ha mange valgmuligheter i smørelunsjen. Selv om tilgjengeligheten av grønnsaker var god i smørelunsjen, viste kartleggingen at bare 41 % av elevene på 3. til 4. trinn forsynte seg med grønnsaker. Det var også svært få som valgte fiskepålegg.\r\nFunnene tyder på at et felles, gratis skolemåltid er positivt for skolemiljøet og fremmer sosiale interaksjoner. Et godt og variert gratis skolemåltid på 1. til 4. trinn har potensiale til å påvirke barns kosthold, men bør kombineres med påvirkningsarbeid dersom elevene skal endre sine matvaner. Det vil være viktig å se på langtidseffekter av gratis skolemåltid på trivsel, skolemiljø og elevers kosthold."

      "en": "Altered hepatic mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation and associated tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle activity contributes to lifestyle-related diseases, and circulating biomarkers reflecting these changes could have disease prognostic value. This study aimed to determine hepatic and systemic changes in TCA-cycle-related metabolites upon the selective pharmacologic enhancement of mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation in the liver, and to elucidate the mechanisms and potential markers of hepatic mitochondrial activity. Male Wistar rats were treated with 3-thia fatty acids (e.g., tetradecylthioacetic acid (TTA)), which target mitochondrial biogenesis, mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation, and ketogenesis predominantly in the liver. Hepatic and plasma concentrations of TCA cycle intermediates and anaplerotic substrates (LC-MS/MS), plasma ketones (colorimetric assay), and acylcarnitines (HPLC-MS/MS), along with associated TCA-cycle-related gene expression (qPCR) and enzyme activities, were determined. TTA-induced hepatic fatty acid β-oxidation resulted in an increased ratio of plasma ketone bodies/nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA), lower plasma malonyl-CoA levels, and a higher ratio of plasma acetylcarnitine/palmitoylcarnitine (C2/C16). These changes were associated with decreased hepatic and increased plasma pyruvate concentrations, and increased plasma concentrations of succinate, malate, and 2-hydroxyglutarate. Expression of several genes encoding TCA cycle enzymes and the malate–oxoglutarate carrier (Slc25a11), glutamate dehydrogenase (Gdh), and malic enzyme (Mdh1 and Mdh2) were significantly increased. In conclusion, the induction of hepatic mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation by 3-thia fatty acids lowered hepatic pyruvate while increasing plasma pyruvate, as well as succinate, malate, and 2-hydroxyglutarate."

      "en": "Background: Psoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated skin disease with systemic inflammation and comorbidities. Although the disease severity may vary over time, many patients suffer from mild to moderate disease. Often local treatment will be sufficient to control the symptoms, but they may have several side effects. ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have shown promising results in clinical trials with mild-to-moderate psoriasis.\r\n\r\nMethods: We explored the impact of phospholipid bound docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid in a 3:1 ratio on immune cells and cytokine networks in peripheral blood of patients with psoriasis. We investigated the inter-relation of plasma cytokine levels and disease severity in 58 patients, and explored the status of circulating immune cell activity in 18 patients with non-severe psoriasis before and during herring roe oil supplementation. Plasma concentration of 22 cytokines was measured by Luminex technology and circulating immune cells were analyzed by multicolor flow cytometry.\r\n\r\nResults: CCL2 levels decreased over time, and IFN-γR1 increased, possibly related to the action of ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. We observed a shift from naïve to effector CD4+ T cells and decreases of CD38 expression on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, CD56bright NK cells and CD14+CD16- classical monocytes.\r\n\r\nConclusions: These findings support the beneficial effect of herring roe oil supplementation."

      "en": "Background: Clinical studies on effects of marine-derived omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), mainly eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and the plant-derived omega-6 (n-6) PUFA linoleic acid (LA) on lipoprotein-lipid components and glucose-insulin homeostasis have shown conflicting results, which may partly be explained by differential responses in females and males. However, we have lacked data on sexual dimorphism in the response of cardiometabolic risk markers following increased consumption of n-3 or n-6 PUFAs. Objective: To explore sex-specific responses after n-3 (EPA + DHA) or n-6 (LA) PUFA supplementation on circulating lipoprotein subfractions, standard lipids, apolipoproteins, fatty acids in red blood cell membranes, and markers of glycemic control/insulin sensitivity among people with abdominal obesity. Methods: This was a randomized double-blind crossover study with two 7-week intervention periods separated by a 9-week washout phase. Females (n = 16) were supplemented with 3 g/d of EPA + DHA (fish oil) or 15 g/d of LA (safflower oil), while males (n = 23) received a dose of 4 g/d of EPA + DHA or 20 g/d of LA. In fasting blood samples, we measured lipoprotein particle subclasses, standard lipids, apolipoproteins, fatty acid profiles, and markers of glycemic control/insulin sensitivity. Results: The between-sex difference in relative change scores was significant after n-3 for total high-density lipoproteins (females/males: −11%*/−3.3%, p = 0.036; *: significant within-sex change), high-density lipoprotein particle size (+2.1%*/−0.1%, p = 0.045), and arachidonic acid (−8.3%*/−12%*, p = 0.012), and after n-6 for total (+37%*/+2.1%, p = 0.041) and small very-low-density lipoproteins (+97%*/+14%, p = 0.021), and lipoprotein (a) (−16%*/+0.1%, p = 0.028). Circulating markers of glucose-insulin homeostasis differed significantly after n-3 for glucose (females/males: −2.1%/+3.9%*, p = 0.029), insulin (−31%*/+16%, p < 0.001), insulin C-peptide (−12%*/+13%*, p = 0.001), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance index 2 (−12%*/+14%*, p = 0.001) and insulin sensitivity index 2 (+14%*/−12%*, p = 0.001), and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (+4.9%*/−3.4%*, p < 0.001). Conclusion: We found sex-specific responses after high-dose n-3 (but not n-6) supplementation in circulating markers of glycemic control/insulin sensitivity, which improved in females but worsened in males. This may partly be related to the sex differences we observed in several components of the lipoprotein-lipid profile following the n-3 intervention."

Male Wistar rats (n = 56) were divided into seven groups in three predefined sub-experiments to study the effects of protein source (casein, chicken fillet, pork fillet, and CPH), the dose-effect of CPH (50% and 100% CPH), and the effects of combining CPH and CO. Rats were fed high-fat diets for 12 weeks, and casein and chicken fillet were used as controls in all sub-experiments. While casein, chicken-, or pork fillet diets resulted in similar weight gain and plasma lipid levels, the CPH diet reduced plasma total cholesterol. This effect was dose dependent and accompanied with the reduced hepatic activities of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthase. Further, rats fed combined CPH and CO showed lower weight gain, and higher hepatic mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, plasma L-carnitine, short-chain acylcarnitines, TMAO, and acetylcarnitine/palmitoylcarnitine. Thus, in male Wistar rats, CPH and CO lowered plasma cholesterol and increased hepatic fatty acid oxidation compared to whole protein diets, pointing to potential health-beneficial bioactive properties of these processed chicken rest raw materials."

      "en": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and periodontitis are chronic inflammatory diseases with several pathogenic pathways in common. Evidence supports an association between the diseases, but the exact underlying mechanisms behind the connection are still under investigation. Lipid, fatty acid (FA) and metabolic profile alterations have been associated with several chronic inflammatory diseases, including RA and periodontitis. Mitochondria have a central role in regulating cellular bioenergetic and whole-body metabolic homeostasis, and mitochondrial dysfunction has been proposed as a possible link between the two disorders. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to explore whole-blood FA, serum lipid composition, and carnitine- and choline derivatives in 78 RA outpatients with different degrees of periodontal inflammation. The main findings were alterations in lipid, FA, and carnitine- and choline derivative profiles. More specifically, higher total FA and total cholesterol concentrations were found in active RA. Elevated phospholipid concentrations with concomitant lower choline, elevated medium-chain acylcarnitines (MC-AC), and decreased ratios of MC-AC and long-chain (LC)-AC were associated with prednisolone medication. This may indicate an altered mitochondrial function in relation to the increased inflammatory status in RA disease. Our findings may support the need for interdisciplinary collaboration within the field of medicine and dentistry in patient stratification to improve personalized treatment. Longitudinal studies should be conducted to further assess the potential impact of mitochondrial dysfunction on RA and periodontitis."

      "en": "Background Low-carbohydrate diets are suggested to exert metabolic benefits by reducing circulating triacylglycerol (TG) concentrations, possibly by enhancing mitochondrial activity. Objective We aimed to elucidate mechanisms by which dietary carbohydrate and fat differentially affect hepatic and circulating TG, and how these mechanisms relate to fatty acid composition. Methods Six-week-old, ∼300 g male Wistar rats were fed a high-carbohydrate, low-fat [HC; 61.3% of energy (E%) carbohydrate] or a low-carbohydrate, high-fat (HF; 63.5 E% fat) diet for 4 wk. Parameters of lipid metabolism and mitochondrial function were measured in plasma and liver, with fatty acid composition (GC), high-energy phosphates (HPLC), carnitine metabolites (HPLC-MS/MS), and hepatic gene expression (qPCR) as main outcomes. Results In HC-fed rats, plasma TG was double and hepatic TG 27% of that in HF-fed rats. The proportion of oleic acid (18:1n–9) was 60% higher after HF vs. HC feeding while the proportion of palmitoleic acid (16:1n–7) and vaccenic acid (18:1n–7), and estimated activities of stearoyl-CoA desaturase, SCD-16 (16:1n–7/16:0), and de novo lipogenesis (16:0/18:2n–6) were 1.5–7.5-fold in HC vs. HF-fed rats. Accordingly, hepatic expression of fatty acid synthase (Fasn) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Acaca/Acc) was strongly upregulated after HC feeding, accompanied with 8-fold higher FAS activity and doubled ACC activity. There were no differences in expression of liver-specific biomarkers of mitochondrial biogenesis and activity (Cytc, Tfam, Cpt1, Cpt2, Ucp2, Hmgcs2); concentrations of ATP, AMP, and energy charge; plasma carnitine/acylcarnitine metabolites; or peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation. Conclusions In male Wistar rats, dietary carbohydrate was converted into specific fatty acids via hepatic lipogenesis, contributing to higher plasma TG and total fatty acids compared with high-fat feeding. In contrast, the high-fat, low-carbohydrate feeding increased hepatic fatty acid content, without affecting hepatic mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation."

      "en": "Objective Discovery of specific markers that reflect altered hepatic fatty acid oxidation could help to detect an individual's risk of fatty liver, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease at an early stage. Lipid and protein metabolism are intimately linked, but our understanding of this crosstalk remains limited. Methods In male Wistar rats, we used synthetic fatty acid analogues (3-thia fatty acids) as a tool to induce hepatic fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial biogenesis, to gain new insight into the link between fatty acid oxidation, amino acid metabolism and TCA cycle-related intermediate metabolites in liver and plasma. Results Rats treated with 3-thia fatty acids had 3-fold higher hepatic, but not adipose and skeletal muscle, expression of the thioesterase 3-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA hydrolase (Hibch), which controls the formation of 3-hydroxyisobutyrate (3-HIB) in the valine degradation pathway. Consequently, 3-thia fatty acid-stimulated hepatic fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis was accompanied by decreased plasma 3-HIB and increased methylmalonic acid (MMA) concentrations further downstream in BCAA catabolism. The higher plasma MMA corresponded to higher MMA-CoA hydrolase activity and hepatic expression of GTP-specific succinyl-CoA synthase (Suclg2) and succinate dehydrogenase (Sdhb), and lower MMA-CoA mutase activity. Plasma 3-HIB correlated positively to plasma and hepatic concentrations of TAG, plasma total fatty acids, plasma NEFA and insulin/glucose ratio, while the reverse correlations were seen for MMA. Conclusion Our study provides new insight into TCA cycle-related metabolic changes associated with altered hepatic fatty acid flux, and identifies 3-HIB and MMA as novel circulating markers reflective of mitochondrial β-oxidation in male Wistar rats."

      "en": "Background & aims Marine-derived omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), mainly eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), lower circulating levels of triacylglycerols (TAGs), and the plant-derived omega-6 (n-6) PUFA linoleic acid (LA) may reduce cholesterol levels. Clinical studies on effects of these dietary or supplemental PUFAs on other blood fat fractions are few and have shown conflicting results. This study aimed to determine effects of high-dose supplemental n-3 (EPA + DHA) and n-6 (LA) PUFAs from high-quality oils on circulating lipoprotein subfractions and standard lipids (primary outcomes), as well as apolipoproteins, fatty acids, and glycemic control (secondary outcomes), in females and males with abdominal obesity. Methods This was a randomized double-blind crossover study with two 7-wk intervention periods separated by a 9-wk washout phase. Females (n = 16) were supplemented with 3 g/d of EPA + DHA (TAG fish oil) or 15 g/d of LA (safflower oil), while males (n = 23) received a dose of 4 g/d of EPA + DHA or 20 g/d of LA. In fasting blood samples, we investigated lipoprotein particle subclasses by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, as well as standard lipids, apolipoproteins, fatty acid profiles, and glucose and insulin. Data were analyzed by linear mixed-effects modeling with ‘subjects’ as the random factor. Results The difference between interventions in relative change scores was among the lipoprotein subfractions significant for total very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs) (n-3 vs. n-6: −38%∗ vs. +16%, p < 0.001; ∗: significant within-treatment change score), large VLDLs (−58%∗ vs. −0.91%, p < 0.001), small VLDLs (−57%∗ vs. +41%∗, p < 0.001), total low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) (+5.8%∗ vs. −4.3%∗, p = 0.002), large LDLs (+23%∗ vs. −2.1%, p = 0.004), total high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) (−6.0%∗ vs. +3.7%, p < 0.001), large HDLs (+11%∗ vs. −5.3%, p = 0.001), medium HDLs (−24%∗ vs. +6.2%, p = 0.030), and small HDLs (−9.9%∗ vs. +9.6%∗, p = 0.002), and among standard lipids for TAGs (−16%∗ vs. −2.6%, p = 0.014), non-esterified fatty acids (−19%∗ vs. +5.5%, p = 0.033), and total cholesterol (−0.28% vs. −4.4%∗, p = 0.042). A differential response in relative change scores was also found for apolipoprotein (apo)B (+0.40% vs. −6.0%∗, p = 0.008), apoA-II (−6.0%∗ vs. +1.5%, p = 0.001), apoC-II (−11%∗ vs. −1.7%, p = 0.025), and apoE (+3.3% vs. −3.8%, p = 0.028). Conclusions High-dose supplementation of high-quality oils with n-3 (EPA + DHA) or n-6 (LA) PUFAs was followed by reductions in primarily TAG- or cholesterol-related markers, respectively. The responses after both interventions point to changes in the lipoprotein–lipid–apolipoprotein profile that have been associated with reduced cardiometabolic risk, also among people with TAG or LDL-C levels within the normal range."

      "nb": "Skolemåltid i Trøndelag er initiert og finansiert av Fylkesmannen i Trøndelag og omfatter åtte kommuner i fylket. Et overordnet mål for skolemåltidsprosjektet er å utvikle en modell for skolemåltider ved barne- og ungdomsskoler, og som kan anvendes ved alle skoler. Prosjektet kom i gang i 2018 og eies av Fylkesmannen i Trøndelag. Forskergruppa Mat og måltider i skole og barnehage ved Høgskulen på Vestlandet inngikk høsten 2019 avtale med fylkesmannen om å evaluere pilotprosjektet ved Verdalsøra ungdomsskole, den største av de skolene som var med. Det ble gjennomført en tverrsnittstudie der tre ulike skolemåltidsformer ble undersøkt: medbrakt matpakke, servert smørelunsj og servert varmmåltid, og det er brukt både kvantitative og kvalitative metoder i datainnsamlingsarbeidet. Ca. 80% av skolens 433 elever svarte på spørreskjemaene, og ca. 70 av skolens elever deltok i fokusgruppesamtaler. Datainnsamlinga ble foretatt i løpet av en skoleuke i februar 2020 av tre forskere og fire bachelorstudenter ved Høgskulen på Vestlandet. Resultatene viser at 77 % av elevene hadde med seg egen matpakke 3-5 dager per uke, mens 12 % sjelden eller aldri hadde med seg mat. Elevene så flere fordeler med at matpakkeordningen var rimelig, de kunne selv bestemme hva og hvor de ville spise, og de mente at maten hjemmefra var sunnere enn den skolen tilbød. Ulempen var at matpakkematen ofte var kjedelig. Smørelunsjen var godt likt, men aller mest benyttet blant 10. klassingene (70 %) og minst blant 8. klassingene (46 %). Elevene mente at det var flere fordeler med at skolen tilbød brød og pålegg: tidsbesparende, lettvint, fersk mat og mulighet til å forsyne seg flere ganger. Ulempene med smørelunsjen var først og fremst at det ble fullt og dannet seg køer når de skulle forsyne seg, og at hygienen var for dårlig. Varmlunsjen derimot var det større skepsis til. Mens 1/5 av de spurte sa at de spiste og likte maten som ble servert, svarte 56 % at de sjelden likte det som ble servert. Kritikken gikk på at det ble ensidig med så mange suppelunsjer, og at de mettet lite. Undersøkelsen viste videre at elevene handlet lite i kantina (mest pga. pris), men at de ønsket seg et større utvalg av sunne matvarer når de handlet. På spørsmålet om hvordan elevene ønsket seg skolemåltidet i framtiden, svarte flertallet at de ønsket at ordningen med smørelunsj skulle fortsette, men at de også kunne ha et par matpakkedager i uka. På spørsmålet om hva elevene anså som det viktigste med lunsjpausen, svarte mange at det var å være sosial og sitte sammen med venner. Å være en del av et vennefellesskap og dele bord var ikke forbeholdt de som hadde med seg mat eller spiste maten skolen bød fram, men omfattet også de som ikke spiste noe. Nesten alle elevene som deltok i fokusgruppene refererte til at de hadde en mer eller mindre fast gjeng som de satt sammen med, slik at de sjelden lurte på hvor de skulle gå i spisepausen. 1/3 av elevene satt ved lunsjbordene mer enn 20 min."

The observed beneficial effects in patients with psoriasis vulgaris using herring roe oil as a dietary supplement prompted this investigation. This randomised, double-blind and placebo-controlled study was designed and performed to explore the efficacy and safety of herring roe oil supplementation in 64 patients with plaque psoriasis (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03359577). The primary end-point was comparing the change in mean Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) scores in the herring roe oil treatment group and the placebo group from baseline to week 26. In the intention-to-treat population, a statistically significant improvement in the mean PASI score was observed with herring roe oil compared to placebo at 26 weeks. In the recruited patient group, the measured improvement was greatest in patients with a PASI score from 5.5–9.9 at baseline."

      "en": "Tetradecylthioacetic acid (TTA) is a synthetic fatty acid with a sulfur substitution in the β-position. This modification renders TTA unable to undergo complete β-oxidation and increases its biological activity, including activation of peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPARs) with preference for PPARα. This study investigated the effects of TTA on lipid and lipoprotein metabolism in the intestine and liver of mice fed a high fat diet (HFD). Mice receiving HFD supplemented with 0.75% (w/w) TTA had significantly lower body weights compared to mice fed the diet without TTA. Plasma triacylglycerol (TAG) was reduced 3-fold with TTA treatment, concurrent with increase in liver TAG. Total cholesterol was unchanged in plasma and liver. However, TTA promoted a shift in the plasma lipoprotein fractions with an increase in larger HDL particles. Histological analysis of the small intestine revealed a reduced size of lipid droplets in enterocytes of TTA treated mice, accompanied by increased mRNA expression of fatty acid transporter genes. Expression of the cholesterol efflux pump Abca1 was induced in the small intestine, but not in the liver. Scd1 displayed markedly increased mRNA and protein expression in the intestine of the TTA group. It is concluded that TTA treatment of HFD fed mice leads to increased expression of genes involved in uptake and transport of fatty acids and HDL cholesterol in the small intestine with concomitant changes in the plasma profile of smaller lipoproteins."

This study investigates the effect of CPH diets in atherosclerosis‐prone apolipoprotein E‐deficient (Apoe−/−) mice. Apoe−/− mice were divided into three groups of 12 animals and fed high‐fat diets with casein (control), Alcalase CPH, or Corolase PP CPH. After 12 weeks, mice were sacrificed, blood samples were collected, and aorta was dissected for subsequent én face analysis. Mice fed Corolase PP CPH but not Alcalase CPH had significantly lower % atherosclerotic plaque area in the aortic arch compared to controls (p = .015 and p = .077, respectively). Plasma and liver cholesterol and triacylglycerol remained constant, but levels of the fatty acid C20:5n‐3 were increased, accompanied by an elevated delta‐5 desaturase index in both CPHs groups. Moreover, a significant reduction of plasma MCP‐1 was detected in Corolase PP CPH compared to control. Overall, our data show that protein hydrolysates from chicken reduced atherosclerosis and attenuated systemic risk factors related to atherosclerotic disorders, not related to changes in the level of plasma cholesterol."

Blood glucose and insulin levels, and liver carbohydrate metabolism gene expression and enzyme activities were determined. In addition, human myotubes and Huh7 liver cells were treated with 1-triple TTA, and glucose and fatty acid oxidation were determined. The level of plasma insulin was significantly reduced in 1-triple TTA-treated rats, resulting in a 32% reduction in the insulin/glucose ratio. The hepatic glucose and glycogen levels were lowered by 22% and 49%, respectively, compared to control. This was accompanied by lower hepatic gene expression of phosphenolpyruvate carboxykinase, the rate-limiting enzyme in gluconeogenesis, and Hnf4A, a regulator of gluconeogenesis. Gene expression of pyruvate kinase, catalysing the final step of glycolysis, was also reduced by 1-triple TTA. In addition, pyruvate dehydrogenase activity was reduced, accompanied by 10-15-fold increased gene expression of its regulator pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 compared to control, suggesting reduced entry of pyruvate into the TCA cycle. Indeed, the NADPH-generating enzyme malic enzyme 1 (ME1) catalysing production of pyruvate from malate, was increased 13-fold at the gene expression level. Despite the decreased glycogen level, genes involved in glycogen synthesis were not affected in livers of 1-triple TTA treated rats. In contrast, the pentose phosphate pathway seemed to be increased as the hepatic gene expression of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) was higher in 1-triple TTA treated rats compared to controls. In human Huh7 liver cells, but not in myotubes, 1-triple-TTA reduced glucose oxidation and induced fatty acid oxidation, in line with previous observations of increased hepatic mitochondrial palmitoyl-CoA oxidation in rats. Importantly, this work recognizes the liver as an important organ in glucose homeostasis. The mitochondrially targeted fatty acid analogue 1-triple TTA seemed to lower hepatic glucose and glycogen levels by inhibition of gluconeogenesis. This was also linked to a reduction in glucose oxidation accompanied by reduced PHD activity and stimulation of ME1 and G6PD, favouring a shift from glucose- to fatty acid oxidation. The reduced plasma insulin/glucose ratio indicate that 1-triple TTA may improve glucose tolerance in rats."

      "en": "Introduction: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) have been suggested to be involved in the regulation of one-carbon metabolism. Previously we have reported effects on plasma concentrations of metabolites along these pathways as well as markers of B-vitamin status in rats following treatment with a pan-PPAR agonist. Here we aimed to investigate the effect on these metabolites after specific activation of the PPARα and PPARγ subtypes. Methods: For a period of 12 days, Male Wistar rats (n = 20) were randomly allocated to receive treatment with the PPARα agonist WY-14.643 (n = 6), the PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone (n = 6) or placebo (n = 8). The animals were sacrificed under fasting conditions, and plasma concentration of metabolites were determined. Group differences were assessed by one-way ANOVA, and planned comparisons were performed for both active treatment groups towards the control group. Results: Treatment with a PPARα agonist was associated with increased plasma concentrations of most biomarkers, with the most pronounced differences observed for betaine, dimethylglycine, glycine, nicotinamide, methylnicotinamide, pyridoxal and methylmalonic acid. Lower levels were observed for flavin mononucleotide. Fewer associations were observed after treatment with a PPARγ agonist, and the most notable was increased plasma serine. Conclusion: Treatment with a PPARα agonist influenced plasma concentration of one-carbon metabolites and markers of B-vitamin status. This confirms previous findings, suggesting specific involvement of PPARα in the regulation of these metabolic pathways as well as the status of closely related B-vitamins."

      "en": "Dietary fatty acids (FAs) affect certain metabolic routes, including pathways controlled by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), but tissue-specific effects are not well-defined. Thus, the aim was to compare the metabolic response in hepatic, adipose, and cardiac tissues after treatment with specific PPAR agonists. Male Wistar rats were randomized into three groups: a control group receiving placebo (n=8); a PPARα agonist group receiving WY-14,643 (n=6); and a PPARγ agonist group receiving rosiglitazone (n=6) for 12 days. All animals received a low-fat standard chow diet and were given a daily dose of placebo or agonist orally. Lipids and FA methyl esters were measured in plasma, liver, and heart and gene expression was measured in liver and adipose tissue, while enzyme activities were measured in liver. Treatment with the PPARα agonist was associated with higher liver mass relative to body weight (liver index), lower plasma, and hepatic total cholesterol, as well as lower plasma carnitine and acylcarnitines, compared with control. In heart, PPARα activation leads to overall lower levels of free FAs and specific changes in certain FAs, compared with control. Furthermore, β-oxidation in liver and the enzymatic activities of well-known PPARα targeted genes were higher following PPARα administration. Overall, rats treated with the PPARα agonist had higher hepatic saturated FAs (SFAs) and monounsaturated FAs (MUFAs) and lower n-6 and n-3 PUFAs, compared to control. Treatment with the PPARγ agonist was associated with a lower liver index, lower plasma triglycerides (TAG) and phospholipids, and higher hepatic phospholipids, compared with control. PPARγ target genes were increased specifically in adipose tissue. Moreover, lower total cardiac FAs and SFA and higher cardiac n-6 PUFA were also associated with PPARγ activation. Altogether, there were characteristic effects of PPARα activation in liver and heart, as well as in plasma. PPARγ effects were not only confined to adipose tissue, but specific effects were also seen in liver, heart, and plasma. In conclusion, short-term treatment with PPAR agonists induced tissue-specific effects on FA composition in liver and heart. Moreover, both PPARα and PPARγ activation lowered plasma TAG and phospholipids, most likely through effects on liver and adipose tissue, respectively. In future studies we aim to reveal whether similar patterns can be found through diet-induced activation of specific pathways."

      "en": "Fatty acid oxidation is a central fueling pathway for mitochondrial ATP production. Regulation occurs through multiple nutrient- and energy-sensitive molecular mechanisms. We explored if upregulated mRNA expression of the mitochondrial enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) may be used as a surrogate marker of increased mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, by indicating an overall shift from glucose to fatty acids as the preferred oxidation fuel. The association between fatty acid oxidation and PDK4 expression was studied in different contexts of metabolic adaption. In rats treated with the modified fatty acid tetradecylthioacetic acid (TTA), Pdk4 was upregulated simultaneously with fatty acid oxidation genes in liver and heart, whereas muscle and white adipose tissue remained unaffected. In MDA-MB-231 cells, fatty acid oxidation increased nearly threefold upon peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα, PPARA) overexpression, and four-fold upon TTA-treatment. PDK4 expression was highly increased under these conditions. Further, overexpression of PDK4 caused increased fatty acid oxidation in these cells. Pharmacological activators of PPARα and AMPK had minor effects, while the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin potentiated the effect of TTA. There were minor changes in mitochondrial respiration, glycolytic function, and mitochondrial biogenesis under conditions of increased fatty acid oxidation. TTA was found to act as a mild uncoupler, which is likely to contribute to the metabolic effects. Repeated experiments with HeLa cells supported these findings. In summary, PDK4 upregulation implies an overarching metabolic shift towards increased utilization of fatty acids as energy fuel, and thus constitutes a sensitive marker of enhanced fatty acid oxidation."

      "en": "Background: Excess levels of serum acylcarnitines, which are intermediate products in metabolism, have been observed in metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, it is not known whether acylcarnitines may prospectively predict risk of cardiovascular death or acute myocardial infarction in patients with stable angina pectoris. Methods and Results: This study included 4164 patients (median age, 62 years; 72% men). Baseline serum acetyl‐, octanoyl‐, palmitoyl‐, propionyl‐, and (iso)valerylcarnitine were measured using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for quartile 4 versus quartile 1 are reported. The multivariable model included age, sex, body mass index, fasting status, current smoking, diabetes mellitus, apolipoprotein A1, apolipoprotein B, creatinine, left ventricular ejection fraction, extent of coronary artery disease, study center, and intervention with folic acid or vitamin B6. During median 10.2 years of follow‐up, 10.0% of the patients died of cardiovascular disease and 12.8% suffered a fatal or nonfatal acute myocardial infarction. Higher levels of the even‐chained acetyl‐, octanoyl‐, and palmitoyl‐carnitines were significantly associated with elevated risk of cardiovascular death, also after multivariable adjustments (HR [95% CI]: 1.52 [1.12, 2.06]; P=0.007; 1.73 [1.23, 2.44]; P=0.002; and 1.61 [1.18, 2.21]; P=0.003, respectively), whereas their associations with acute myocardial infarction were less consistent. Conclusions: Among patients with suspected stable angina pectoris, elevated serum even‐chained acylcarnitines were associated with increased risk of cardiovascular death and, to a lesser degree with acute myocardial infarction, independent of traditional risk factors."

      "en": "Increasing evidence suggests that oxidative DNA damage accumulates in atherosclerosis. Recently, we showed that a genetic variant in the human DNA repair enzyme NEIL3 was associated with increased risk of myocardial infarction. Here, we explored the role of Neil3/NEIL3 in atherogenesis by both clinical and experimental approaches. Human carotid plaques revealed increased NEIL3 mRNA expression which significantly correlated with mRNA levels of the macrophage marker CD68. Apoe−/−Neil3−/− mice on high-fat diet showed accelerated plaque formation as compared to Apoe−/− mice, reflecting an atherogenic lipid profile, increased hepatic triglyceride levels and attenuated macrophage cholesterol efflux capacity. Apoe−/−Neil3−/− mice showed marked alterations in several pathways affecting hepatic lipid metabolism, but no genotypic alterations in genome integrity or genome-wide accumulation of oxidative DNA damage. These results suggest a novel role for the DNA glycosylase Neil3 in atherogenesis in balancing lipid metabolism and macrophage function, potentially independently of genome-wide canonical base excision repair of oxidative DNA damage."

      "en": "Background: Hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction plays an important role in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Methyl donor supplementation has been shown to alleviate NAFLD, connecting the condition to the one-carbon metabolism. Thus, the objective was to investigate regulation of homocysteine (Hcy) and metabolites along the choline oxidation pathway during induction of hepatic steatosis by the fatty acid analogue tetradecylthiopropionic acid (TTP), an inhibitor of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. Methods: Mice were fed a control diet, or diets containing 0.3 %, 0.6 %, or 0.9 % (w/w) TTP for 14 days. Blood and liver samples were collected, enzyme activities and gene expression were analyzed in liver, lipid and fatty acid composition in liver and plasma, one-carbon metabolites, B-vitamin status, carnitine and acylcarnitines were analyzed in plasma. Results: Liver mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation decreased by 40 % and steatosis was induced in a dose dependent manner; total lipids increased 1.6-fold in animals treated with 0.3 % TTP, 2-fold with 0.6 % TTP and 2.1 fold with 0.9 % TTP compared to control. The higher hepatic concentration of fatty acids was associated with shortening of carbon-length. Furthermore, the inhibited fatty acid oxidation led to a 30-fold decrease in plasma carnitine and 9.3-fold decrease in acetylcarnitine at the highest dose of TTP, whereas an accumulation of palmitoylcarnitine resulted. Compared to the control diet, TTP administration was associated with elevated plasma total Hcy (control: 7.2 ± 0.3 umol/L, 0.9 % TTP: 30.5 ± 5.9 umol/L) and 1.4-1.6 fold increase in the one-carbon metabolites betaine, dimethylglycine, sarcosine and glycine, accompanied by changes in gene expression of the different B-vitamin dependent pathways of Hcy and choline metabolism. A positive correlation between total Hcy and hepatic triacylglycerol resulted. Conclusions: The TTP-induced inhibition of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation was not associated with increased hepatic oxidative stress or inflammation. Our data suggest a link between mitochondrial dysfunction and the methylation processes within the one-carbon metabolism in mice."

In this study, we investigated the effect of PPAR activation on circulating and urinary one-carbon metabolites as well as markers of B-vitamin status. Male Wistar rats (n = 20) received for 50 weeks either a high-fat control diet or a high-fat diet with tetradecylthioacetic acid (TTA), a modified fatty acid and pan-PPAR agonist with high affinity towards PPAR. Hepatic gene expression of PPARα, PPARβ/δ and the enzymes involved in the choline oxidation pathway were analyzed and concentrations of metabolites were analyzed in plasma and urine. TTA treatment altered most biomarkers, and the largest effect sizes were observed for plasma concentrations of dimethylglycine, nicotinamide, methylnicotinamide, methylmalonic acid and pyridoxal, which were all higher in the TTA group (all p < 0.01). Hepatic Pparα mRNA was increased after TTA treatment, but genes of the choline oxidation pathway were not affected. Long-term TTA treatment was associated with pronounced alterations on the plasma and urinary concentrations of metabolites related to one-carbon metabolism and B-vitamin status in rats."

      "en": "Dietary intake of marine omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) can change the plasma profile from atherogenic to cardioprotective. In addition, there is growing evidence that proteins of marine origin may have health benefits. We investigated a phospholipid-protein complex (PPC) from krill that is hypothesized to influence lipid metabolism, inflammation, and redox status. Male Wistar rats were fed a control diet (2% soy oil, 8% lard, 20% casein), or diets where corresponding amounts of casein and lard were replaced with PPC at 3%, 6%, or 11% (wt %), for four weeks. Dietary supplementation with PPC resulted in significantly lower levels of plasma triacylglycerols in the 11% PPC-fed group, probably due to reduced hepatic lipogenesis. Plasma cholesterol levels were also reduced at the highest dose of PPC. In addition, the plasma and liver content of n-3 PUFAs increased while n-6 PUFAs decreased. This was associated with increased total antioxidant capacity in plasma and increased liver gene expression of mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (Sod2). Finally, a reduced plasma level of the inflammatory mediator interleukin-2 (IL-2) was detected in the PPC-fed animals. The present data show that PPC has lipid-lowering effects in rats, and may modulate risk factors related to cardiovascular disease progression."

      "en": "Background: Marine food is an important source of omega-3 fatty acids with beneficial health effects. Oils from marine organisms have different fatty acid composition and differ in their molecular composition. Fish oil (FO) has a high content of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids mainly esterified to triacylglycerols, while in krill oil (KO) these fatty acids are mainly esterified to phospholipids. The aim was to study the effects of these oils on the lipid content and fatty acid distribution in the various lipid classes in liver and brain of mice. Methods: Mice were fed either a high-fat diet (HF), a HF diet supplemented with FO or with KO (n = 6). After six weeks of feeding, liver and brain lipid extracts were analysed using a shotgun and TAG lipidomics approach. Student t-test was performed after log-transformation to compare differences between study groups. Results: Six weeks of feeding resulted in significant changes in the relative abundance of many lipid classes compared to control mice. In both FO and KO fed mice, the triacylglycerol content in the liver was more than doubled. The fatty acid distribution was affected by the oils in both liver and brain with a decrease in the abundance of 18:2 and 20:4, and an increase in 20:5 and 22:6 in both study groups. 18:2 decreased in all lipid classes in the FO group but with only minor changes in the KO group. Differences between the feeding groups were particularly evident in some of the minor lipid classes that are associated with inflammation and insulin resistance. Ceramides and diacylglycerols were decreased and cholesteryl esters increased in the liver of the KO group, while plasmalogens were decreased in the FO group. In the brain, diacylglycerols were decreased, more by KO than FO, while ceramides and lactosylceramides were increased, more by FO than KO. Conclusion: The changes in the hepatic sphingolipids and 20:4 fatty acid levels were greater in the KO compared to the FO fed mice, and are consistent with a hypothesis that krill oil will have a stronger anti-inflammatory action and enhances insulin sensitivity more potently than fish oil."

      "en": "Background: Lipid abnormalities, enhanced inflammation and oxidative stress seem to represent a vicious circle in atherogenesis, and therapeutic options directed against these processes seems like a reasonable approach in the management of atherosclerotic disorders. Krill oil (RIMFROST Sublime®) is a phospholipid-rich oil with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA): docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) ratio of 1.8:1. In this pilot study we determined if krill oil could favourable affect plasma lipid parameters and parameters involved in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. Methods: The study was conducted as a 28 days intervention study examining effect-parameters of dietary supplementation with krill oil (832.5 mg EPA and DHA per day). 17 healthy volunteers in the age group 18–36 (mean age 23 ± 4 years) participated. Plasma lipids, lipoprotein particle sizes, fatty acid composition in plasma and red blood cells (RBCs), plasma cytokines, antioxidant capacity, acylcarntines, carnitine, choline, betaine, and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) were measured before and after supplementation. Results: Plasma triacylglycerol (TAG) and large very-low density lipoprotein (VLDL) & chylomicron particle concentrations decreased after 28 days of krill oil intake. A significant reduction in the TAG/HDL cholesterol resulted. Krill oil supplementation decreased n-6/n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) ratio both in plasma and RBCs. This was due to increased EPA, DHA and docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) and reduced amount of arachidonic acid (AA). The increase of n-3 fatty acids and wt % of EPA and DHA in RBC was of smaller magnitude than found in plasma. Krill oil intake increased the antioxidant capacity, double bond index (DBI) and the fatty acid anti-inflammatory index. The plasma atherogenicity index remained constant whereas the thrombogenicity index decreased. Plasma choline, betaine and the carnitine precursor, γ-butyrobetaine were increased after krill oil supplementation whereas the TMAO and carnitine concentrations remained unchanged. Conclusion: Krill oil consumption is considered health beneficial as it decreases cardiovascular disease risk parameters through effects on plasma TAGs, lipoprotein particles, fatty acid profile, redox status and possible inflammation. Noteworthy, no adverse effects on plasma levels of TMAO and carnitine were found."

Male Wistar rats were fed either a control diet with 20% w/w casein as the protein source, or an experimental diet where 6, 14 or 20% w/w of the casein was replaced with the same amount of CP for four weeks. Rats fed CP had reduced plasma total homocysteine level and markedly increased levels of the choline pathway metabolites betaine, dimethylglycine, sarcosine, glycine and serine, as well as the transsulfuration pathway metabolites cystathionine and cysteine. Hepatic mRNA level of enzymes involved in homocysteine remethylation, methionine synthase and betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase, were unchanged, whereas cystathionine gamma-lyase of the transsulfuration pathway was increased in the CP treated rats. Plasma concentrations of vitamin B2, folate, cobalamin, and the B-6 catabolite pyridoxic acid were increased in the 20% CP-treated rats. In conclusion, the CP diet was associated with lower plasma homocysteine concentration and higher levels of serine, choline oxidation and transsulfuration metabolites compared to a casein diet. The status of related B-vitamins was also affected by CP."

Four groups of mice were fed a high-fat diet with 20% casein (control group) or 15% casein and 5% of peptide fractions (treatment groups E1, E2 and E4) for 6 weeks. Weight gain was reduced in mice fed E1 and E4-diets compared to control, despite a similar feed intake. Reduced plasma and liver triacylglycerol levels in E1 and E4-mice were linked to reduced fatty acid synthase (FAS) activity and hepatic expression of lipogenic genes. By contrast, plasma and liver lipids increased in the E2 group, concomitant with increased hepatic FAS activity and Δ9 desaturase gene expression. Shotgun lipidomics showed that MUFAs were significantly reduced in the E1 and E4 groups, whereas PUFAs were increased, and the opposite was observed in the E2 group. In conclusion, bioactive peptides with distinctive properties could potentially be isolated from salmon hydrolysates."

      "en": "Fish consumption is considered health beneficial as it decreases cardiovascular disease (CVD)-risk through effects on plasma lipids and inflammation. We investigated a salmon protein hydrolysate (SPH) that is hypothesized to influence lipid metabolism and to have anti-atherosclerotic and anti-inflammatory properties. 24 female apolipoprotein (apo) E−/− mice were divided into two groups and fed a high-fat diet with or without 5% (w/w) SPH for 12 weeks. The atherosclerotic plaque area in aortic sinus and arch, plasma lipid profile, fatty acid composition, hepatic enzyme activities and gene expression were determined. A significantly reduced atherosclerotic plaque area in the aortic arch and aortic sinus was found in the 12 apoE−/− mice fed 5% SPH for 12 weeks compared to the 12 casein-fed control mice. Immunohistochemical characterization of atherosclerotic lesions in aortic sinus displayed no differences in plaque composition between mice fed SPH compared to controls. However, reduced mRNA level of Icam1 in the aortic arch was found. The plasma content of arachidonic acid (C20:4n-6) and oleic acid (C18:1n-9) were increased and decreased, respectively. SPH-feeding decreased the plasma concentration of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α and GM-CSF, whereas plasma cholesterol and triacylglycerols (TAG) were unchanged, accompanied by unchanged mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT)-activity. These data show that a 5% (w/w) SPH diet reduces atherosclerosis in apoE−/− mice and attenuate risk factors related to atherosclerotic disorders by acting both at vascular and systemic levels, and not directly related to changes in plasma lipids or fatty acids."

      "en": "Background: Marine derived oils are rich in long-chain polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, in particular eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which have long been associated with health promoting effects such as reduced plasma lipid levels and anti-inflammatory effects. Krill oil (KO) is a novel marine oil on the market and is also rich in EPA and DHA, but the fatty acids are incorporated mainly into phospholipids (PLs) rather than triacylglycerols (TAG). This study compares the effects of fish oil (FO) and KO on gene regulation that influences plasma and liver lipids in a high fat diet mouse model. Methods: Male C57BL/6J mice were fed either a high-fat diet (HF) containing 24% (wt/wt) fat (21.3% lard and 2.3% soy oil), or the HF diet supplemented with FO (15.7% lard, 2.3% soy oil and 5.8% FO) or KO (15.6% lard, 2.3% soy oil and 5.7% KO) for 6 weeks. Total levels of cholesterol, TAG, PLs, and fatty acid composition were measured in plasma and liver. Gene regulation was investigated using quantitative PCR in liver and intestinal epithelium. Results: Plasma cholesterol (esterified and unesterified), TAG and PLs were significantly decreased with FO. Analysis of the plasma lipoprotein particles indicated that the lipid lowering effect by FO is at least in part due to decreased very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) content in plasma with subsequent liver lipid accumulation. KO lowered plasma non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) with a minor effect on fatty acid accumulation in the liver. In spite of a lower omega-3 fatty acid content in the KO supplemented diet, plasma and liver PLs omega-3 levels were similar in the two groups, indicating a higher bioavailability of omega-3 fatty acids from KO. KO more efficiently decreased arachidonic acid and its elongation/desaturation products in plasma and liver. FO mainly increased the expression of several genes involved in fatty acid metabolism, while KO specifically decreased the expression of genes involved in the early steps of isoprenoid/ cholesterol and lipid synthesis. Conclusions: The data show that both FO and KO promote lowering of plasma lipids and regulate lipid homeostasis, but with different efficiency and partially via different mechanisms."

      "en": "Diabetes Mellitius Type 2 (T2DM) is a well-known lifestyle disease which also can occur genetically. The development of T2DM usually occurs when insulin sensitive tissues lose their capability of taking up glucose. Since β-cells are glucose-sensitive, they compensate by secreting more insulin to achieve normoglycemic conditions. Organisms can live with this insulin resistance, or the β-cell’s compensation can fail which leads to hyperglycemia and also often hyperlipidemic conditions. This ultimately results in β-cell dysfunction which is the hallmark of T2DM. T2DM is considered a lifestyle disease, often related to obesity. Peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPARs) are nuclear receptors linked to increased fatty acid oxidation and synthesis, as well as to anti-inflammatory mechanisms, making them interesting targets regarding metabolic diseases. PPARs have also been linked to the regulation of insulin secretion from β-cells. Tetradecylthioacetic acid (TTA) is a synthetic fatty acid which cannot undergo β-oxidation. TTA is a pan-PPAR agonist since it stimulates activation of all the three isotypes of PPAR (α, β/δ and γ). TTA has been studied in several tissues and cell types, but its effect on pancreas or β-cell lines is not known. In this thesis, the insulinoma cell line INS-1E was used to investigate whether TTA could influence cell growth, insulin secretion and gene expression both at normal and high-glucose conditions. Palmitic acid (PA) was used as a neutral fatty acid control. 150 μM TTA was chosen for further studies based on studies of cell growth and gene expressions of PPAR response genes. In general, there was found to be low induction of PPAR-mediated genes by both PPAR specific agonists and TTA. In addition, TTA stimulated Ppargc1a gene expression which seemed to be PPAR α and γ independent. 24h TTA-treatment was found to increase mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation capacity, but decreased insulin secretion. After 72 h of high-glucose concentrations (30 mM), TTA-treated cells displayed reduced cell growth compared to control. This reduction in growth rate was also observed in cells treated with a combination of high-glucose and PA. In addition, several genes important for β-cell survival, reactive oxygen species protection, insulin production and metabolism were highly influenced by both high-glucose and TTA/PA treatment. Overall, combined with high-glucose treatment, TTA had similar effects in INS-1E cells as PA which indicated β-cell dysfunction due to glucolipotoxicity."

      "en": "Background: Herring roe is an underutilized source of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) for human consumption with high phospholipid (PL) content. Studies have shown that PL may improve bioavailability of n-3 PUFAs. Arctic Nutrition’s herring roe product MOPL™30 is a PL: docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-rich fish oil mixture, with a DHA:eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) ratio of about 3:1, which is also rich in choline. In this pilot study, we determined if MOPL30 could favorably affect plasma lipid parameters and glucose tolerance in healthy young adults. Methods: Twenty female and one male adults, between 22 and 26 years of age, participated in the study. Participants took encapsulated MOPL30, 2.4 g/d EPA + DHA, for 14 days, and completed a three-day weighed food record before and during the capsule intake. Plasma lipids and their fatty acid (FA) composition, plasma and red blood cell (RBC) phosphatidylcholine (PC) FA composition, acylcarnitines, choline, betaine and insulin were measured before and after supplementation (n = 21), and one and four weeks after discontinuation of supplementation (n = 14). An oral glucose tolerance test was performed before and after supplementation. Results: Fasting plasma triacylglycerol and non-esterified fatty acids decreased and HDL-cholesterol increased after 14 days of MOPL30 intake (p < 0.05). The dietary records showed that PUFA intake prior to and during capsule intake was not different. Fasting plasma glucose was unchanged from before to after supplementation. However, during oral glucose tolerance testing, blood glucose at both 10 and 120 min was significantly lower after supplementation with MOPL30 compared to baseline measurements. Plasma free choline and betaine were increased, and the n-6/n-3 polyunsaturated (PUFA) ratio in plasma and RBC PC were decreased post-supplementation. Four weeks after discontinuation of MOPL30, most parameters had returned to baseline, but a delayed effect was observed on n-6 PUFAs. Conclusions: Herring roe rich in PL improved the plasma lipid profile and glycemic control in young adults with an overall healthy lifestyle."

      "en": "Background: There is growing evidence that fish protein hydrolysate (FPH) diets affect mitochondrial fatty acid metabolism in animals. The aim of the study was to determine if FPH could influence fatty acid metabolism and inflammation in transgene mice expressing human tumor necrosis factor alpha (hTNFα). Methods: hTNFα mice (C57BL/6 hTNFα) were given a high-fat (23%, w/w) diet containing 20% casein (control group) or 15% FPH and 5% casein (FPH group) for two weeks. After an overnight fast, blood, adipose tissue, and liver samples were collected. Gene expression and enzyme activity was analysed in liver, fatty acid composition was analyzed in liver and ovarian white adipose tissue, and inflammatory parameters, carnitine, and acylcarnitines were analyzed in plasma. Results: The n-3/n-6 fatty acid ratio was higher in mice fed the FPH diet than in mice fed the control diet in both adipose tissue and liver, and the FPH diet affected the gene expression of Δ6 and Δ9 desaturases. Mice fed this diet also demonstrated lower hepatic activity of fatty acid synthase. Concomitantly, a lower plasma INF-γ level was observed. Plasma carnitine and the carnitine precursor γ-butyrobetaine was higher in the FPH-group compared to control, as was plasma short-chained and medium-chained acylcarnitine esters. The higher level of plasma acetylcarnitine may reflect a stimulated mitochondrial and peroxisomal β-oxidation of fatty acids, as the hepatic activities of peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase 1 and mitochondrial carnitine palmitoyltransferase-II were higher in the FPH-fed mice. Conclusions: The FPH diet was shown to influence hepatic fatty acid metabolism and fatty acid composition. This indicates that effects on fatty acid metabolism are important for the bioactivity of protein hydrolysates of marine origin."

      "en": "Background: A beneficial effect of a high n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LCPUFA) intake has been observed in heart failure patients, who are frequently insulin resistant. We investigated the potential influence of impaired glucose metabolism on the relation between dietary intake of n-3 LCPUFAs and risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in patients with coronary artery disease. Methods: This prospective cohort study was based on the Western Norway B-Vitamin Intervention Trial and included 2,378 patients with coronary artery disease with available baseline glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and dietary data. Patients were sub-grouped as having no diabetes (HbA1c <5.7%), pre-diabetes (HbA1c ≥5.7%), or diabetes (previous diabetes, fasting baseline serum glucose ≥7.0, or non-fasting glucose ≥11.1 mmol/L). AMI risk was evaluated by Cox regression (age and sex adjusted), comparing the upper versus lower tertile of daily dietary n-3 LCPUFA intake. Results: The participants (80% males) had a mean age of 62 and follow-up of 4.8 years. A high n-3 LCPUFA intake was associated with reduced risk of AMI (hazard ratio 0.38, 95%CI 0.18, 0.80) in diabetes patients (median HbA1c = 7.2%), whereas no association was observed in pre-diabetes patients. In patients without diabetes a high intake tended to be associated with an increased risk (hazard ratio1.45, 95%CI 0.84, 2.53), which was significant for fatal AMI (hazard ratio 4.79, 95%CI 1.05, 21.90) and associated with lower HbA1c (mean ± standard deviation 4.55 ±0.68 versus 4.92 ±0.60, P = 0.02). No such differences in HbA1c were observed in those with pre-diabetes or diabetes. Conclusions: A high intake of n-3 LCPUFAs was associated with a reduced risk of AMI, independent of HbA1c, in diabetic patients, but with an increased risk of fatal AMI and lower HbA1c among patients without impaired glucose metabolism. Further studies should investigate whether patients with diabetes may benefit from having a high intake of n-3 LCPUFAs and whether patients with normal glucose tolerance should be careful with a very high intake of these fatty acids."

      "en": "Fish oil (FO) has been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties in animal models of inflammatory bowel disease, but how fish peptides (FP) influence intestinal inflammation has been less studied. Male Wistar rats, divided into five groups, were included in a 4-week dietary intervention study. Of the groups, four were exposed in the fourth week to 5 % dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) to induce colitis, while one group was unexposed. The diets were: (1) control, (2) control + DSS, (3) FO (5 %) + DSS, (4) FP (3·5 %) + DSS, (5) FO + FP + DSS. Following DSS intake, weight and disease activity index (DAI) were assessed, and histological combined score (HCS), selected colonic PG, cytokines, oxidative damage markers and mRNA levels were measured. FP reduced HCS, tended to lower DAI (P = 0·07) and reduced keratinocyte chemoattractant/growth-regulated oncogene levels, as compared with the FO diet. FP also reduced mRNA levels of Il-6 and Cxcl1, although not significantly. FO intake increased the DAI as compared with DSS alone. PGE3 levels increased after the FO diet, and even more following FO + FP intake. The FP diet seems to have a protective effect in DSS-induced colitis as compared with FO. A number of beneficial, but non-significant, changes also occurred after FP v. DSS. A combined FO + FP diet may influence PG synthesis, as PGE3 levels were higher after the combined diet than after FO alone."

      "en": "Background: A high intake of n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) is usually recommended in secondary prevention of coronary heart disease, particularly in patients with high triglyceride levels. Furthermore, a beneficial effect has been observed in patients with heart failure, who are frequently insulin resistant. Objective: The aim was to study the influence of impaired glucose metabolism and diabetes mellitus on the relation between dietary intake of n-3 LCPUFAs and risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in patients undergoing coronary angiography for suspected coronary artery disease in 2000-2004. Design: This study included 2378 participants of the Western Norway B-Vitamin Intervention Trial (WENBIT). Daily intakes of n-3 LCPUFAs were estimated based on average dietary intakes during the last year as reported in a food-frequency questionnaire at baseline. Hazard ratios (HRs (95% CI)) of AMI (fatal and non-fatal) according to n-3 LCPUFA intake were calculated using Cox-regression adjusted for cardiovascular risk factors by comparing upper vs. lowest tertile and as trend across tertiles. Patients were followed until 31 December 2006.\r\n\r\nResults: Mean age of the participants was 62 years and 80% were male. Patients were sub-grouped into non-diabetics (HbA1c <5.7%), pre-diabetics (HbA1c ≥5.7%), and diabetics (diagnosed), and were also stratified according to median triglyceride levels. Among patients with diabetes there was a significantly reduced risk of AMI in the upper vs. the lowest tertile of n-3 LCPUFA intake, multivariate HR (95% CIs) 0.34 (0.14, 0.82), P for trend=0.008. In non-diabetic patients with HbA1c <5.7% there was an increased risk of AMI in the upper tertile of n-3 LCPUFA intake, 1.97 (1.05, 3.67), P for trend=0.02. Risk estimates were strengthened in their respective directions in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients with triglyceride levels above median. No risk associations were seen in pre-diabetics.\r\n\r\nConclusions: Among patients with established coronary artery disease, a high intake of n-3 LCPUFAs was associated with a reduced risk of AMI in diabetic patients and an increased risk of AMI in non-diabetic patients. The effects were particularly pronounced in those with elevated triglyceride levels. "

Recently, supplementation with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) has been associated with improved left ventricular function and functional capacity in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. We investigated the long-term effects of the pan-PPAR agonist tetradecylthioacetic acid (TTA) and/or high-dose fish oil (FO) on cardiac fatty acid (FA) composition and lipid metabolism. Male Wistar rats were given one out of four different 25% (w/v) fat diets: control diet; TTA diet; FO diet; or diet containing both TTA and FO. Results: After 50 weeks n-3 PUFA levels were increased by TTA and FO in the heart, whereas liver levels were reduced following TTA administration. TTA was associated with a decrease in arachidonic acid, increased activities of carnitine palmitoyltransferase II, fatty acyl-CoA oxidase, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, and fatty acid synthase in the heart. Furthermore, cardiac Ucp3 and Cact mRNA was upregulated. Conclusions: Long-term treatment with the pan-PPAR agonist TTA or high-dose FO induced marked changes in PUFA composition and enzymatic activity involved in FA metabolism in the heart, different from liver. Changes included increased FA oxidation and a selective increase in cardiac n-3 PUFA."

      "en": "Background: Psychiatric patients often require chronic treatment with antipsychotic drugs, and while rats are frequently used to study antipsychotic-induced metabolic adverse effects, long-term exposure has only partially mimicked the appetite-stimulating and weight-inducing effects found in the clinical setting. Antipsychotic-induced effects on serum lipids are also inconsistent in rats, but in a recent study we demonstrated that subchronic treatment with the orexigenic antipsychotic olanzapine resulted in weight-independent increase in serum triglycerides and activation of lipogenic gene expression in female rats. In addition, a recent long-term study in male rats showed that chronic treatment with antipsychotic drugs induced dyslipidemic effects, despite the lack of weight gain. Aims: In the current study, we sought to examine long-term effects of antipsychotic drugs on weight gain, lipid levels and lipid composition after twice-daily administration of antipsychotics to female rats, and to investigate potential beneficial effects of the lipid-lowering agent tetradecylthioacetic acid (TTA), a modified fatty acid. Methods: Female rats were exposed to orexigenic antipsychotics (olanzapine or clozapine), metabolically neutral antipsychotics (aripiprazole or ziprasidone), or TTA for 8 weeks. Separate groups received a combination of clozapine and TTA or olanzapine and TTA. The effects of TTA and the combination of olanzapine and TTA after 2 weeks were also investigated. Results: The antipsychotic-induced weight gain and serum triglyceride increase observed in the subchronic setting was not present after 8 weeks of treatment with antipsychotics, while lipid-lowering effect of TTA was much more pronounced in the chronic than in the subchronic setting, with concomitant upregulation of key oxidative enzymes in the liver. Unexpectedly, TTA potentiated weight gain in rats treated with antipsychotics. Conclusion: TTA is a promising candidate for prophylactic treatment of antipsychotic-induced dyslipidemic effects, but a more valid long-term rat model for antipsychotic-induced metabolic adverse effects is required."

      "en": "The administration of tetradecylthioacetic acid (TTA), a hypolipidemic and anti-inflammatory modified bioactive fatty acid, has in several experiments based on high fat diets been shown to improve lipid transport and utilization. It was suggested that increased mitochondrial and peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation in the liver of Wistar rats results in reduced plasma triacylglycerol (TAG) levels. Here we assessed the potential of TTA to prevent tumor necrosis factor (TNF) a-induced lipid modifications in human TNFa (hTNFa) transgenic mice. These mice are characterized by reduced b-oxidation and changed fatty acid composition in the liver. The effect of dietary treatment with TTA on persistent, low-grade hTNFa overexpression in mice showed a beneficial effect through decreasing TAG plasma concentrations and positively affecting saturated and monounsaturated fatty acid proportions in the liver, leading to an increased anti-inflammatory fatty acid index in this group. We also observed an increase of mitochondrial b-oxidation in the livers of TTA treated mice. Concomitantly, there were enhanced plasma levels of carnitine, acetyl carnitine, propionyl carnitine, and octanoyl carnitine, no changed levels in trimethyllysine and palmitoyl carnitine, and a decreased level of the precursor for carnitine, called c-butyrobetaine. Nevertheless, TTA administration led to increased hepatic TAG levels that warrant further investigations to ascertain that TTA may be a promising candidate for use in the amelioration of inflammatory disorders characterized by changed lipid metabolism due to raised TNFa levels."

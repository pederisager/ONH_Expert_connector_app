    "en": "Background: High participation rates are important for a colorectal cancer (CRC) screening programme to be effective. Having a long travelling distance to screening centres may impede participation.\r\n\r\nMethods: We analysed the association between driving time from home address to screening centre and participation among individuals invited to screening with faecal immunochemical test (FIT) (n = 68,624) or sigmoidoscopy (n = 46,076) in a randomized trial in Norway in 2012-17. Two screening centres were involved. We fitted multiple logistic regression models, adjusted for demographic, socioeconomic and health characteristics, and reported odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).\r\n\r\nResults: Participation rates were 58.9 % (n = 40,445) for FIT and 51.9 % (n = 23,911) for sigmoidoscopy. In sigmoidoscopy, participation was 56.9 % and 47.9 % in those living < 20 and > 60 min by car from the screening centres, respectively. For each 10 min driving time increase, OR for participating in sigmoidoscopy screening was 0.93 (95 % CI 0.91-0.95). There was a significant difference between the two screening centres (p-value for heterogeneity <0.001). Participation in FIT screening were 61.2 % and 57.1 % in those with < 20 and > 60 min driving time, respectively, and the OR was 0.98 (95 % CI 0.96-0.99) for each 10 min increase (heterogeneity between screening methods, P-value <0.001). Among those with a positive FIT, compliance to colonoscopy was higher in those living < 20 compared to > 60 min from the centres (95.1 % vs. 92.9 %, respectively, OR 0.86; 95 % CI 0.77-0.93 for each 10 min increase).\r\n\r\nConclusions: Driving time to screening centre was a significant predictor of participation, mainly in sigmoidoscopy. There were local differences in the impact of driving time on participation. Driving time also affected compliance to colonoscopy after a positive FIT. When planning a CRC screening programme, one should consider offering people living far from screening sites special assistance to facilitate their participation."

      "en": "Public health systems should guarantee universal access to health care services, including cancer screening. We assessed whether certain population subgroups were underrepresented among participants in colorectal cancer screening with sigmoidoscopy and faecal immunochemical testing (FIT). Between 2012 and 2019, about 140 000 individuals aged 50 to 74 years were randomly invited to once-only sigmoidoscopy or first round of FIT screening. Our study included 46 919 individuals invited to sigmoidoscopy and 70 019 to FIT between 2012 and 2017. We used logistic regression models to evaluate if demographic and socioeconomic factors and use of certain drugs were associated with participation. Twenty-four thousand one hundred and fifty-nine (51.5%) individuals attended sigmoidoscopy and 40 931 (58.5%) FIT screening. Male gender, young age, low education and income, being retired or unemployed, living alone, being an immigrant, long driving time to screening centre, and use of antidiabetic and psychotropic drugs were associated with low participation in both screening groups. Many of these factors also predicted low acceptance of colonoscopy after positive FIT. While male gender, young age and living alone were more strongly associated with nonparticipation in FIT than sigmoidoscopy, low education and income, being retired or immigrant and long driving time were more strongly associated with nonparticipation in sigmoidoscopy than FIT. In conclusion, participation was lower in sigmoidoscopy than FIT. Predictors of nonparticipation were similar between arms. However, low socioeconomic status, being an immigrant and long driving time affected participation more in sigmoidoscopy screening, suggesting that FIT may guarantee more equal access to screening services than sigmoidoscopy."

      "en": "Background: High participation rates are important for a colorectal cancer (CRC) screening programme to be effective. Having a long travelling distance to screening centres may impede participation.\r\n\r\nMethods: We analysed the association between driving time from home address to screening centre and participation among individuals invited to screening with faecal immunochemical test (FIT) (n = 68,624) or sigmoidoscopy (n = 46,076) in a randomized trial in Norway in 2012-17. Two screening centres were involved. We fitted multiple logistic regression models, adjusted for demographic, socioeconomic and health characteristics, and reported odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).\r\n\r\nResults: Participation rates were 58.9 % (n = 40,445) for FIT and 51.9 % (n = 23,911) for sigmoidoscopy. In sigmoidoscopy, participation was 56.9 % and 47.9 % in those living < 20 and > 60 min by car from the screening centres, respectively. For each 10 min driving time increase, OR for participating in sigmoidoscopy screening was 0.93 (95 % CI 0.91-0.95). There was a significant difference between the two screening centres (p-value for heterogeneity <0.001). Participation in FIT screening were 61.2 % and 57.1 % in those with < 20 and > 60 min driving time, respectively, and the OR was 0.98 (95 % CI 0.96-0.99) for each 10 min increase (heterogeneity between screening methods, P-value <0.001). Among those with a positive FIT, compliance to colonoscopy was higher in those living < 20 compared to > 60 min from the centres (95.1 % vs. 92.9 %, respectively, OR 0.86; 95 % CI 0.77-0.93 for each 10 min increase).\r\n\r\nConclusions: Driving time to screening centre was a significant predictor of participation, mainly in sigmoidoscopy. There were local differences in the impact of driving time on participation. Driving time also affected compliance to colonoscopy after a positive FIT. When planning a CRC screening programme, one should consider offering people living far from screening sites special assistance to facilitate their participation."

      "en": "The psychosocial work environment is of great importance for regaining health and productivity after a workplace disaster. Still, there is a lack of knowledge about the impact of a disaster on the psychosocial work environment. The purpose of this study was to examine whether employees' perceptions of role clarity, role conflicts, and predictability in their work situation changed from before to after a workplace terrorist attack. We combined data from two prospective work environment surveys of employees in three governmental ministries that were the target of the 2011 Oslo terrorist attack. A first two-wave survey was conducted 4–5 years and 2–3 years before the attack, and a second three-wave survey took place 10 months, 2 years, and 3 years after the attack. Of 504 individuals who were employed at the time of the bombing, 220 were employed in both pre- and post-disaster periods, participated in both the first and the second survey, and consented to the linking of data from the two surveys. We found no significant changes in levels of role clarity, role conflict, and predictability from before to after the terrorist attack. Adjusting for sex, age and education had no effect on the results. The findings suggest that perceptions of the psychosocial working environment are likely to be maintained at previous levels in the aftermath of a workplace disaster. Considering the importance of the psychosocial work environment for regaining health and productivity, the findings are important for the preparation for, and management of, future crises."

      "en": "Objectives Studies show that social support may reduce the negative psychological effects of terror. The aim was to explore the effects of the psychosocial work environment on sick leave risk among governmental employees after a workplace bomb attack. Design We linked longitudinal survey data collected at 10 and 22 months after the bombing with registry data on doctor-certified sick leave collected from 42 months before the attack to 33 months after the attack. ORs and rate ratios were estimated with mixed effects hurdle models. Setting The bombing of the government ministries in Oslo, Norway, 22 July 2011. Participants We identified 1625 participants from a cohort of 3520 employees working in the ministries during the bombing in 2011. Results After adjustment for confounders, social support from coworkers reduced the odds of sick leave (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.93), and there was marginal evidence for reduced odds with support from superior (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.03). A social work climate, an innovative climate and a human resource primacy climate (HRP) reduced the sick leave risk (eg, HRP OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.90). The hurdle model found no associations between psychosocial support at work and the duration of sick leave. Conclusions Psychosocial support at work can enhance employees’ work ability after terror and reduce the sick leave risk by more than 20%. However, a supportive psychosocial work environment did not reduce the duration of sickness absence. The protective role of psychosocial work factors on sick leave may be most significant when employees are at work and interact with their work environment."

      "en": "Background\r\nStudies have shown that terrorist attacks affect the mental and physical health of persons exposed to terrorism. When terror strikes at the workplace where people spend much time, and should feel safe, the health consequences for those affected might be severe. The aim of the study was to determine whether psychological and social work factors moderates effects of exposure to a workplace terrorist attack on subsequent doctor-certified sickness absence.\r\n\r\nMethods\r\nThe study design combined survey data with register data on sickness absence. Data on exposure to the attack, and psychosocial working conditions were collected by a web-based questionnaire 10 months after the attack. Survey data was linked to registry data on doctor-certified sickness absence over the one-year time period following baseline. The survey response rate was 56% (n = 1974), where 80.6% (1591) gave consent to link survey data to data on sickness absence. Exposure to the attack was assessed as “Directly-”, or “Indirectly exposed”. Psychological and social work factors were measured by the General Questionnaire for Psychological and Social factors at Work (QPSNordic). Data were analyzed with negative binominal hurdle regressions.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nDirect exposure to the attack increased the odds of becoming sick-listed if role clarity was average (OR = 1.50) or high (OR = 2.13), but not if low (OR = 1.17). Direct exposure was associated with higher sickness absence rates if control over work pace was low (RR = 1.61). Role conflict, support from co-workers, and -superior showed weaker evidence of moderating effects of exposure on sickness absence.\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\nExposure to the bomb explosion, as well as psychosocial working conditions affect the risk of employee sickness absence. Psychosocial working conditions seems to moderate effects of exposure to workplace terrorism on subsequent sickness absence. Organizations would benefit from striving for good psychological and social working conditions both as preventions against illness and sickness absence, and as measures in the aftermath of a workplace terrorist attack."

      "en": "Many services depend on having staff 24 hours a day, including petroleum onshore and offshore facilities, and the health care sector. Employees engaged in shift work are exposed to working hours outside the standard 8-16 working day. Working at evenings or nights, or rotating between different combinations of daytime, evening time, and nights may be challenging to the individual in terms of regulation of circadian rhythm, sleep deprivation or challenges to work-family balance, which in turn may affect the mental health of workers. Work is a central part of most peoples&#39; lives. Thus, events occurring in relation to work may affect the mental health of workers in both positive and negative ways. The overall aims of the current thesis were to elucidate the ways shift schedules in combination with psychological and social conditions at work may influence the mental health of workers. To gain such knowledge a range of different shift schedules employed in the petroleum industry and within the health-care sector were studied. Furthermore, emphasis was on how working conditions relate to mental health by studying working conditions as predictors of mental health and mental health as predictor of working conditions. Participants were recruited from six companies operating in the Norwegian onshore- and offshore petroleum industry, and from members registered in the Norwegian Nurses Organization. Study 1 analyzed 1471 employees operating at onshore and offshore facilities. Differences in mental distress between various shift schedules were elucidated by comparing offshore shift types with zero, seven or 14 consecutive nights. Permanent-daytime (14 days) was compared with permanent-night shift (14 days), and swing shift (7 nights / 7days) was compared with permanent-night shifts. Among onshore workers, permanent-day shift was compared with rotating-shift work (day, evening and night). No statistical significant differences in mental distress between workers in different shift schedules were demonstrated. Six psychological and social work exposures were studied. Differences in work exposures between the shift schedules were demonstrated. Onshore revolving-shift workers reported lower job control compared with onshore daytime workers. Offshore swing-shift workers reported lower job control compared to permanent-night and -day workers offshore. Permanent night-workers reported higher job control, fair- and empowering leadership, and support from co-workers and superior compared to swing-shift workers. Associations between the six work factors and mental distress were analyzed separately for onshore and offshore workers, and with increasing level of adjustment. A specific hypothesis for study 1, was to elucidate whether the personality trait neuroticism influenced associations between work factors and mental distress. Onshore workers exhibited associations between job demands, job control, role conflict, and support and mental distress. Adjusted for neuroticism only role conflict reached statistical significance, whereas adjusted for all work factors only job control reached statistical significance. Among offshore workers all six work factors were associated with mental distress, also when adjusted for neuroticism. When adjusted for all work factors, role conflict and support were no longer statistically significant. In the fully adjusted model job demands, role clarity, and support reached statistical significance. Study 2 elucidated prospective effects of shift work, and six psychological and social work factors on mental distress among nurses. Specific to this study were the elucidation of moderating effects between shift work, and work factors on mental distress, elucidation of cross-lagged effects between work exposures and mental distress, and analyzing symptoms of anxiety and depression as separate outcomes. A total of 1582 nurses responded both at baseline and follow-up, and were included in the study. This study analyzed effects of night work compared to non-night work, and rotating-shifts with permanent-shifts. No statistical significant effects of shift schedules on anxiety and depression were demonstrated. However, differences in work exposures between shift schedules were demonstrated. Nurses working nights reported higher levels of role clarity and job demands, and lower levels of decision authority compared to non-night workers. Nurses working rotating-shifts reported higher levels of job demands, role clarity, and skill discretion, and lower levels of role clarity and decision authority compared to permanent-shift nurses. No statistically significant moderation effects between night work and rotating-shift work, and work content on mental distress were demonstrated. Study 2 demonstrated distress-to-work effects, where baseline symptoms of anxiety and depression predicted follow-up reporting of role clarity, role conflict, fair leadership, and social support. Work-to-distress effects were also demonstrated between job demands and symptoms of depression. Study 3 elucidated prospective effects of shift work, job type, psychological, social and physical work factors on mental distress among offshore workers. Both direct effects and interaction effects were examined. Unlike the two other studies, study 3 included job type, and exposure to noise and cold as predictors of mental distress. Furthermore, effects of 12 specific psychological and social work factors on mental distress were elucidated. Study 3 also examined reverse effects, but not with cross-lagged models as in paper 2. A total of 531 offshore workers responded both at baseline and follow-up, and were included in the study. In this study swing-shift was compared to permanent-day time. No statistically significant effects of shift work, or job type on mental distress were detected. Furthermore, no statistically significant moderation effects between shift work, and work exposures, or job type and work exposures on mental distress were detected. However, work-to-distress and distress-to-work effects were demonstrated. Nine out of twelve psychological and social work factors, and exposure to noise and cold were associated with follow-up mental distress. Adjusted for baseline distress, only exposure to noise reached statistical significance. Adjusted for all work exposures, only quantitative demands reached statistical significance. Baseline mental distress was associated with 11 out of 12 follow-up psychological and social work exposures, and exposure to noise. Adjusted for baseline work factor only learning demands was predicted by baseline mental distress. In conclusion, none of the shift schedules studied in the current thesis seems to affect the mental health of workers. However, this does not mean that such effects do not exist. The current thesis has pointed to several methodological challenges of studying mental health effects of shift work. Among these factors the healthy worker effect is central. Another possible explanation for the current findings may be that shift work may not be as important for mental health as hypothesized, at least not in Norway. Effects of shift work on mental distress seem not to be moderated by work content. However, this does not mean that such effects do not exist. The lack of moderating effects may be explained by methodological short comings such as restricted variance in exposures and outcome, or the healthy worker effect. Work content seems to affect the mental health of workers, and the mental health of workers seems to affect the perception of work content. However, the study of the reciprocal relationship between work content and mental health problems would benefit from employing longitudinal designs with different follow-up intervals in order to capture both short- and long term effects of work exposure. It seems reasonable that mental health problems may affect the perception of working conditions more promptly than exposure to adverse working conditions affect the mental health of workers."

Workers on six shift-schedules answered a questionnaire (1,471 of 2,628 employees). Psychological and social work factors were measured by QPSNordic, mental distress was measured by HADS and neuroticism was measured by EPQ. The results showed 1) No differences in mental distress between workers in different shift schedules, 2) Revolving-shift workers reported higher neuroticism compared to day workers, 3) Swing-shift workers and revolving-shift workers reported lower job control compared to permanent-night and -day workers, 4) Job demands and role conflict were associated with more mental distress. Job control, role clarity, support, and leadership were associated with lower mental distress, 5) Neuroticism influenced the relationship between psychosocial work factors and mental distress. The present study did not find differences in mental distress between shift schedules. Job characteristics may be contributing factors when determining health effects of shift work."

      "en": "Purpose:\r\nThis study aims to explore relationships between exposure to bullying at work and intention to leave the organisation, actual leaving the workplace, and exclusion from working life through sick leave or rehabilitation or disability pension.\r\n\r\nDesign/methodology/approach:\r\nA prospective design with two surveys of a national representative sample of the Norwegian work force was used (n=1,775). The response rate at the first data collection in 2005 was 56.4 per cent, and 70 per cent at the second data collection in 2007. Bullying was measured using two measurement methods: self‐labelled victims of bullying and exposure to bullying behaviour, respectively.\r\n\r\nFindings:\r\nThis study shows partial support for Leymann's assumption that bullying at work will lead to exclusion from working life. Logistic regressions showed that victims of bullying considered leaving their work more often than did individuals who were not bullied, on both measurement times. The results also showed that victims have changed employer more often than non‐victims. However, most victims are still working full time or part time two years later.\r\n\r\nPractical implications:\r\nPrevention of workplace bullying must be handled through procedures on an organisational level. Rehabilitation programs and reintegration must be offered for employees unable to stay in their job. Counselling should be available for those who experience bullying or consider leaving their job."

      "nb": "The research literature on the involuntary unemployed indicates that work has a number of beneficial effects on mental health. Nonetheless, certain psychosocial factors seem to increase the risk for employees to develop poor mental health, particularly anxiety and depressive symptoms: High job demands and low degree of influence and social support, or low degree of appreciation, career opportunities and job security are considered as risk factors in this respect. In addition, there is still a need to identify work environment factors that prevent people with poor mental health from falling into long-term sickness and disability pension. So far, to our knowledge, only one study has been done in this field. It indicated that good leadership serves as protection against long-term sick leave among employees with moderate depression symptoms."

A non-clinical sample (n = 132) completed the NEO-FFI personality inventory and the IIP-64C. In accordance with previous studies, Agreeableness and Extraversion were linked with IIP-64C, regardless of type of partitioning of the IIP-64C item set. Neuroticism had a strong association with interpersonal problems based on normative scores, but statistic ipsation removed this association. While the normative IIP-64C scores did not confirm the structural properties of the Circumplex model, the ipsatized scores did. In conclusion, the use of statistical ipsation of the IIP-64C could be a useful addition to traditional personality assessment procedures."

    "en": "Objectives: The aim of the current study was to elucidate prospective effects\r\nof both shift schedules and work environment on mental distress. Methods: A total of 2059 nurses participated at baseline (38.1%), and 1582 nurses\r\ncompleted wave 2 of the survey (76.8%). Psychosocial work factors were\r\nmeasured by the General Nordic Questionnaire for Psychological and Social\r\nfactors at work and the Swedish Demand–Control–Support Questionnaire.\r\nMental distress was measured by Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.\r\nResults: Shiftwork was not associated with ‘‘caseness’’ anxiety or depression. Effects of shiftwork on mental distress were not moderated by\r\npsychosocial work factors. Mental distress predicted role clarity, role conflict, fair leadership, and social support. Job demands predicted symptoms of\r\ndepression. Conclusions: Whether psychosocial working conditions buffer\r\nmental health effects of shiftwork remains undecided. Prospective studies\r\nwith multiple measurement points are needed to elucidate potential mutual\r\nrelationships between work factors and mental distress.\r\n"

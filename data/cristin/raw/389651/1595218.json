    "en": "Greater body mass index (BMI) has been associated with increased risk of psoriasis in case–control and cross-sectional studies, however, the evidence from prospective studies has been limited. We conducted a systematic review and dose–response meta-analysis of different adiposity measures and the risk of psoriasis to provide a more robust summary of the evidence based on data from prospective studies. PubMed and Embase databases were searched for relevant studies up to August 8th 2017. Summary relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random effects model. The summary relative risk (RR) for a 5 unit increment in BMI was 1.19 (95% CI 1.10–1.28, I2 = 83%, n = 7). The association appeared to be stronger at higher compared to lower levels of BMI, pnonlinearity < 0.0001, and the lowest risk was observed at a BMI around 20. The summary RR was 1.24 (95% CI 1.17–1.31, I2 = 0%, pheterogeneity = 0.72, n = 3) per 10 cm increase in waist circumference, 1.37 (95% CI 1.23–1.53, I2 = 0%, pheterogeneity = 0.93, n = 3) per 0.1 unit increase in waist-to-hip ratio, and 1.11 (95% CI 1.07–1.16, I2 = 47%, pheterogeneity = 0.15, n = 3) per 5 kg of weight gain. Adiposity as measured by BMI, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and weight gain is associated with increased risk of psoriasis."

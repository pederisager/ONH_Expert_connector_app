    "en": "A history of hypertension has been associated with increased risk of endometrial cancer in several studies, but the results have not been consistent. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of case-control and cohort studies to clarify the association between hypertension and endometrial cancer risk. PubMed and Embase databases were searched up to 27th of February 2016. Prospective and case-control studies which reported adjusted relative risk estimates and 95% confidence intervals of endometrial cancer associated with a hypertension diagnosis were included. Summary relative risks were estimated using a random effects model. Nineteen case-control studies and 6 cohort studies were included. The summary RR was 1.61 (95% CI: 1.41–1.85, I2 = 86%) for all studies, 1.73 (95% CI: 1.45–2.06, I2 = 89%) for case-control studies and 1.32 (95% CI: 1.12–1.56, I2 = 47%) for cohort studies. The association between hypertension and endometrial cancer was weaker, but still significant, among studies with adjustment for smoking, BMI, oral contraceptive use, and parity, compared to studies without such adjustment. This meta-analysis suggest an increased risk of endometrial cancer among patients with hypertension, however, further studies with more comprehensive adjustments for confounders are warranted to clarify the association."

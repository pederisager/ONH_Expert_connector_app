    "en": "\r\n\r\nObjective\r\n\r\nThe objective of this study was to systematically review the literature on the prevalence of eating disorders (EDs) during the DSM-5 era, and to report rates of point- and lifetime prevalence.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethod\r\n\r\nA PubMed search was conducted targeting articles on the epidemiology of EDs, in particular, reported rates of prevalence. The review was performed in accordance with PRISMA guidelines, and was limited to DSM-5 based eating disorder diagnoses published between 2012 and 2017.\r\n\r\n\r\nResults\r\n\r\nA total of 19 studies fulfilled inclusion criteria and were included in the study.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiscussion\r\n\r\nFollowing the transition to DSM-5, it is evident that the prevalence of eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS)/other specified feeding and eating disorders (OSFED) has decreased as intended, and there is preliminary evidence suggesting that rates of anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN) and binge eating disorder (BED) have increased. Further, we observed higher rates of BED prevalence among females compared to males, with rates increasing with age. A limitation to the study was the search date, and that none of the included studies investigated the “new” DSM-5 feeding disorders avoidant restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID), pica or rumination disorder warranting attention in future studies investigating the epidemiology of feeding and eating disorders.\r\n\r\n\r\nKeywords\r\n\r\nEpidemiology – Prevalence – Eating disorders – DSM-5 – Systematic review"

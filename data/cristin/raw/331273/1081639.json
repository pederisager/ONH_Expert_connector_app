    "en": "This study examines the effect of market knowledge and specific assets on formal contracting in international exporting relationships. Market knowledge refers to the familiarity with the way foreign markets function. A sample of 131 international buyer-supplier relationships is the\r\nbasis for the empirical analysis. When market knowledge is low or modest, there is a positive association between specific assets and formal contracting because low market knowledge enforces the problem of asymmetric information and perceived opportunism with successive comprehensive formal contracting. When substantial asset specificity is combined with high market knowledge, the need for formal contracting diminishes because better market knowledge facilitates in lowering transactional uncertainties and exchange hazards and enforces trust building that attenuate the need for comprehensive formal contracting.

    "en": "This study underlines the importance of relationship duration and how it affects procurement and purchasing relationships. Relationship history and relational norms have become significant factors for explaining the scope and stability of purchasing relationships (Dwyer et al., 1987; Sweeney and Webb, 2002; Liu et al., 2009). Relationship duration facilitate in developing a combination of behavioural components, contractual arrangement and trust that overcome organisation problems in inter-firm businesses and it offers an opportunity to ensure stability, and comparative advantages for the procurement partners. The authors explore how the prior length of an inter-firm relationship helps in handling problems associated to behavioural uncertainty, opportunism and ex post transaction costs. The findings highlight the critical role of the prior length of business relationships and how it can help in attenuating organisation problems in procurement relationships. This study supports that relationship duration is a significant antecedent in overcoming organisational difficulties in business relationships and also enhancing relationship quality."

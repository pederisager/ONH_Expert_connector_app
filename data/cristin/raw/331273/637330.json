    "en": "The marketing literature acknowledges the importance of relationship duration and interpersonal relationships. Macneil's (1980) relational exchange theory indicates that relationship duration facilitates in developing relational norms i.e. verbal and non-verbal credible commitments, supporting a balanced governance mechanism between exchange partners. Ring and Van de Ven (1994) explained that relationship duration could affect interfirm governance or interorganizational relationships (IORs). Based onstudies conducted in the sphere of transaction cost, relational exchange and social exchange theories, the authors analyze how relationship duration influences the implementation of governance forms in the relationship maintenance period of business-to-business relationships. The presence of complexity (Porter, 1985) in buyer-supplier relationships cultivates uncertainty, opportunism and ex post transaction costs. Logistic partners in order to ensure the reliability and dependability of a supply chain use managerial and behavioral components. Business partners marginalized these relational hindrances through relational norms, formal and informal contracts and trust. Business relationship duration also encourage business partners to consolidate the antecedents for relationship duration. Empirical work shows that relational governance is associated with trust and that it improves the performance of interorganizational exchange (Heide and John, 1990). This article explores the association between opportunism, ex post transaction cost, behavioral uncertainty and relationship duration and proposes three research propositions."

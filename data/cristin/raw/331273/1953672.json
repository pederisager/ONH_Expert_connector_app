    "en": "This study evaluates the implementation costs of cloud-based booking platforms (CBBPs) to manage vehicle queues in warehouses and investigates how cloud-based booking platforms support inter-organizational logistics processes. To understand the impact of CBBPs, we interviewed logistics managers concerning the structure of the CBBP processes, salient platform features, and their effects on inter-organizational dynamics. In addition, we conducted an analytical modeling simulation to compute the economic impact of each investment scenario. Our results show that CBBP benefits, and their financial viability, are sensitive to the size of a company and the selected decision driver (cost vs. time optimization). Hence, our findings challenge the standard view that adopting digital technologies in inter-organizational settings is an easy task."

      "en": "This article uses a UNESCO application case study in Vestfold, Norway to analyse the challenges of internationalisation in a home region as this relates to managing the Development of a World Heritage Site. Relevant stakeholders are analysed using empirical material such as reports and conversations. The research questions are the following: who are the stakeholders, and what are their interests in a concrete case dealing with societal development through cultural heritage? Resource dependency and potential conflicts between stakeholders are analysed. The research findings based on a UNESCO application case study from Norway demonstrate that cultural heritage is an area with the involvement of many kinds of stakeholders, from public bodies to private actors and representatives of civil society such as history associations. The management of the area is complicated by the complexity of the actors involved, given their different interests and strengths, and by the resource dependency between these actors, which is based on assets that are difficult to analyse in the ways that managementrelated issues are usually analysed. The article thus stresses that there is a greater risk of mismanagement in cultural heritage than in, for example, more traditional private Companies or public bodies."

      "en": "This paper identifies the determinants of environmental degradation for the resource-rich economy of Brunei Darussalam. Annual data for selected variables on the economy of Brunei Darussalam is obtained from the World Development Indicators (WDI) for the period 1990–2020. To explore the potential cointegration relationship between environmental degradation and its determinants, we apply autoregressive distributed lagged modeling (ARDL). The long-run findings indicated that an increasing income level and energy consumption had caused environmental degradation in Brunei Darussalam, as their coefficients are positive and statistically significant. On the other hand, trade openness has improved the overall quality of the environment in Brunei Darussalam as its impact on CO2 emissions is negative and statistically significant. Urbanization has a negative but insignificant influence on CO2 emissions. The short-run results showed that trade openness, urbanization, and energy consumption had degraded the quality of the environment. Our causality analysis show that CO2 emissions are unilaterally related to GDP per capita and energy consumption, while energy consumption casts a one-way impact on GDP per capita. Moreover, urbanization is unilaterally causing CO2 emissions, energy consumption, and GDP per capita. Finally, a one-way causal relationship is seen between trade openness and energy consumption. Overall, our results are quite interesting as the long-run and short-run determinants of environmental degradation are not uniform. The study's findings provide practical insights for Brunei Darussalam's policymakers to cope with ecological degradation."

      "en": "Environmental degradation is posing several challenges worldwide and hence Saudi Arabia (KSA) is no exception. This paper therefore focuses on the economy of KSA to explore the main determinants of environmental degradation. The analysis of the study is based on the time-series data covering the period 1990–2022. The “Autoregressive Distributed Lag Modeling (ARDL)” is used for the estimation purpose which is recently developed in the literature for handling non-stationary time series data. For testing the direction of relationship, the study utilizes the causality testing procedure. The results indicated that energy consumption, GDP per capita and foreign direct investment have degraded the environmental quality of KSA during the study period. On the other hand, financial development and natural resource sector have improved the quality of the environment. Furthermore, trade openness appeared to be an irrelevant factor in determining the quality of the environment due to its insignificant coefficient. Finally, the causality testing showed several one-way and one two-way casual relationships among the variables used in the study. Based on the results, the current study presents several important policy implications for the policymakers of KSA. We hope that the current study will add to the literature on the economy of KSA enormously."

      "en": "The existing body of literature has extensively investigated and debated the pivotal role of natural resources in the dynamics of economic growth. However, the explicit impact of natural resources on the quality of the environment is yet to be explored comprehensively. Amid this backdrop, this study explores the significant role that natural resources play in the growth processes of OECD member economies and the potential impact on environmental management. For our research model, the data for the OECD member countries (1997–2021) was collected from the “World Development Indicators (WDI)”. We applied econometric tools namely, fixed effects, generalized least squares and two stages least squares for empirical results. A causality exercise based on the Dumitrescu and Hurlin (DH) is conducted to identify the direction causation. Our results show that the use of natural resources adversely impacts the quality of the environment in OECD economies. The square term of natural resources is negative and significant, confirming the validity of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis between the use of natural resources and environmental degradation. When the cubic term of natural resources is entered into the estimated model positively, it shows that the potential shape of the EKC hypothesis is N-shaped. Our results also demonstrate that energy consumption and urbanization have worsened environmental quality, while trade openness and per capita income have improved the quality of the environment in OECD countries. The causality analysis showed several one-way as well as two-ways relationships. Our study's findings provide valuable insights from the OECD economies, which can be used to design and execute policies for managing natural resources to address environmental problems."

The study utilizes data covering the period 1987–2019 and employs the autoregressive distributed lag model (ARDL) for the extraction of results from the designed models. The results of the study indicate that trade openness has indeed impacted the rate of inflation not only negatively but also significantly. This means that trade openness could be used as a tool to fight against higher inflation. Similarly, government expenditure, economic growth, exchange rate and money supply positively affect inflation. Money supply and government expenditures positively affect the rate of inflation in the short run. The study has important policy implications for the Chinese economy."

      "en": "Entrepreneurship has recently attracted great attention from researchers due to its enormous growth-enhancing effects. However, the empirical literature has not paid sufficient attention to the explicit relationship between entrepreneurship and economic growth. This paper aims to explore the potential relationship between entrepreneurship and economic growth by focusing on the emerging BRICS economies. The study utilizes data from 2002 to 2021 and employs a range of estimation tools including pooled least squares, fixed effects, generalized least squares and two stages least squares. The results find that entrepreneurship has a positive and significant influence on economic growth in the BRICS economies. Similarly, trade openness and physical capital have also contributed to overall economic growth. Moreover, the relationship between human capital and economic growth is both positive and statistically significant for the BRICS economies. Finally, the causality testing revealed a one-way relationship running from entrepreneurship towards economic growth. Given the results obtained in this study, encouraging young people to pursue entrepreneurial careers is likely to contribute towards addressing the problem of youth unemployment in the BRICS economies."

      "en": "This study employs transaction cost logic to investigate effects of market knowledge on formal contracting. The model maintains that market knowledge moderates the effects of supplier specific assets and buyer specific assets on contracting in international buyer–seller relationships. We collected survey data from 131 international buyer–supplier relationships and applied regression analysis to test the hypotheses. The data suggest that the need for formal contracts diminishes when substantial supplier specific assets accompany high market knowledge. In contrast, the need for formal contracting increases when substantial buyer specific assets are combined with high market knowledge. This study provides new insights for B2B marketing literature by shedding light on the influence of market knowledge on formal contracts. The discussion addresses the study’s implications for interorganizational theory and practice."

      "en": "This study provides a unique perspective in environmental sustainability and research domain by linking climate change and terrorism, which is a new and unexplored factor of environmental sustainability. Through a newly developed predictive model, this study assessed the impact of terrorism on environmental sustainability in the MENA region countries for the time span of 2002–2019 This study also tested the validity of the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis. The empirical results indicate that terrorism is harmful for environmental sustainability as it increases CO2 emissions, while trade openness and urbanization have a favorable influence on environmental sustainability as they are negatively associated with CO2 emissions. The results also revealed a positive and statistically significant relationship between energy consumption and CO2 emissions. Empirically, the results confirmed the validity of the EKC hypothesis in the MENA region. The causality exercise shows a one-way causality from CO2 emissions and urbanization towards terrorism. Similarly, a unilateral causality is witnessed from energy consumption towards urbanization and from per capita income towards CO2 emissions. Finally, a two-way causality is detected between trade and terrorism, energy consumption and terrorism and between per capita income and terrorism. These empirical findings provide valuable insights for various stakeholders, i.e., government authorities, policymakers, regulators, practitioners, and researchers."

      "en": "This paper examines the effect of per capita income, trade openness, energy consumption, and financial development on the ASEAN region's environmental degradation. We obtained data from the World Development Indicators (WDI) during the years 2001–2020 to test our research model. For analysis, we applied panel data techniques such as pooled least squares, fixed effects, generalized least squares (GLS), and two stages least squares (2SLS). We also conducted the causality analysis to determine the direction of the relationship among the models' variables. Our models' results show the validity of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis in the ASEAN region as per capita income and its square term possess positive and negative coefficients. The results also show the presence of an N-shaped EKC in ASEAN region a deviation from the conventional literature. Moreover, the results illustrate that increasing energy consumption, trade openness, and financial development positively contribute to environmental degradation in ASEAN economies. The causality analysis shows a two-way causality between trade openness and financial development, and environmental degradation and trade openness. We observed oneway causality, running a) from energy consumption and per capita income towards financial development, b) from per capita income towards trade openness, and c) from financial development towards environmental degradation. The study's results contribute to the environmental degradation literature and provide a better understanding of environmental degradation for policymakers in ASEAN economies."

Appropriate cointegration techniques for time series data are employed to estimate the specified models and extract results.\r\nFindings\r\n\r\nThe results provide evidence about the positive and significant role that natural resources have played in the economic growth of Brunei Darussalam. Similarly, trade openness and domestic investment have also positively and significantly impacted the long-run economic growth. On the other hand, the impacts of government expenditure and the growth of human capital on economic growth are although positive but insignificant statistically in the long run. The short-run results show that natural resources, government expenditures and domestic investment have influenced economic growth both positively and significantly. Moreover, the positive and significant impact of trade openness on economic growth, which was observed in the long run, turned negative and insignificant in the short run. Finally, the insignificant positive relationship between the growth of human capital and economic growth observed in the long run remained the same in the short run.\r\nOriginality/value\r\n\r\nThis paper studies the resource curse hypothesis for Brunei Darussalam for the first time, and therefore, the findings will be of significant interest for policymakers and researchers.\r\n"

Next, the study employs the resource-based view of the firm to implicate top management commitment as a moderator of influences of green innovation practices on customer cooperation. Using survey design methodology, we collected data from different 181 ISO 14001 certified Turkish manufacturing firms. We tested the proposed hypotheses by using the hierarchical multivariate regression approach. The direct effect of top management commitment on green process innovation is significant, while its effect on green managerial innovation is insignificant. However, the results show that manufacturer-customer relationships support top management commitment as a positive moderator of the relationship between green innovation practices and customer cooperation. Our results underscore the vital role played by top management in the firm’s efforts to accomplish sustainability objectives and enhance interfirm cooperation. Further, the study contributes to the literature by revising the available literature on the different roles of top management commitment in green supply chains and business relationships."

This study conducts a bibliometric review of the available literature on environmental degradation and poverty and summarizes the existing researches. By applying suitable keywords, we retrieved 175 peer-reviewed articles from the Web of Science published between 1993 and 2020. We utilized the visualization of similarity viewer (VOSviewer) for this bibliometric study and classified the leading publications, prominent journals, and institutions. Furthermore, our bibliometric review found a phenomenon in investigation that people are indifference about the impact of environmental degradation on rising poverty levels in poor and developing countries. In terms of contributions, this study classifies 4 leading thematic clusters that identify how environmental degradation increases poverty. By employing text mining analysis, this research connects specific environmental terms accountable for the recent rise in global poverty. We finally recommend that including other databases to strengthen the findings of environmental degradation and poverty is one of the future research directions."

Additionally, the study reveals pertinent characteristics of BP literature, including conceptualizations, measurements, methods, theories and research settings. Finally, this study develops an integrative conceptual model and presents avenues for future research.\r\n\r\nPractical implications\r\nThis study provides insight to practitioners that create and develop brand personalities. The study would inform managers concerning the outcomes of BP.\r\n\r\nOriginality/value\r\nTo the best knowledge of the authors, this is the first systematic review that synthesizes existing empirical research on antecedents and consequences of BP of consumer products."

      "en": "Purpose: Environmental degradation is recognized as a serious problem globally, and hence, Saudi Arabia is no exception. This paper aims to focus on the economy of Saudi Arabia to identify the determinants of environmental degradation. Design/methodology/approach: Time series data spanning from 1971 to 2014 is used and analyzed using the recently developed autoregressive distributed lag modeling approach. Findings: The obtained results reflected that natural resources, per person income and urbanization, have impacted environmental degradation both positively and significantly in the long run. Similarly, an insignificant negative relationship is established between trade openness and environmental degradation. Moreover, energy consumption has positively but insignificantly affected environmental degradation. In the short run, only per capita income has positively influenced environmental degradation while the rest of the variables have lost either significance levels or their direction of relationship has reversed. Originality/value: As this is a pioneering study on the economy of Saudi Arabia, therefore, the authors assume that policymakers will find the findings of the current study very useful while formulating and implementing policies to control environmental degradation."

      "en": "This study evaluates the implementation costs of cloud-based booking platforms (CBBPs) to manage vehicle queues in warehouses and investigates how cloud-based booking platforms support inter-organizational logistics processes. To understand the impact of CBBPs, we interviewed logistics managers concerning the structure of the CBBP processes, salient platform features, and their effects on inter-organizational dynamics. In addition, we conducted an analytical modeling simulation to compute the economic impact of each investment scenario. Our results show that CBBP benefits, and their financial viability, are sensitive to the size of a company and the selected decision driver (cost vs. time optimization). Hence, our findings challenge the standard view that adopting digital technologies in inter-organizational settings is an easy task."

This synthesis explores gender differences and similarities from a wide range of online settings, including readiness for adoption of new technology, willingness to make online payments, trust in online vendors, perception and behavior toward online business websites and perceived online service quality.\r\nDesign/methodology/approach\r\n\r\nA systematic approach was adopted to derive and then analyze the existing literature. The authors accessed relevant literature from three electronic databases. After a thorough screening process and applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, the study shortlisted 61 academic articles from an initial pool of 187 papers.\r\n\r\nFindings\r\n\r\nThe findings reveal more differences than similarities between men and women as online consumers. Men generally have more favorable attitudes toward e-tailers (electronic retailing), online purchase/re-purchase and e-payments than women do. Social influences positively affect the online purchase intentions of men and women, but they have a more substantial effect on women. Privacy concerns negatively affect the online trust of men and women, but they also manifest a more significant influence on women.\r\nPractical implications\r\n\r\nFindings of review guide practitioners in formulating effective positioning and communication strategies that enable them to appeal to gender-specific consumer segments in multiple products and business contexts. It offers guidelines to online businesses for developing e-business platforms (websites) that persuade the target audience across gender groups, based on consumer browsing and web navigation preferences.\r\nOriginality/value\r\n\r\nThis review fulfills the need for a systematic synthesis of empirical research vis-à-vis online consumer behavior studies to find gender-specific perceptions, attitudes and behaviors.\r\n"

We developed a model of opportunism-trust relationships, which we analyzed in the context of a smallholder agro-commodity supply market (SHACSM). The data source is a survey of 444 buyer-supplier relationships from the cocoa industry of Ghana. The analysis shows that relational satisfaction, cooperation and information exchange reduce perceptions of opportunism consistent with the literature. However, multigroup analysis suggests differences in perception between men and women farm owners/managers. While men perceived the important role of information exchange in reducing perceptions of opportunism, women farm owners/managers were more concerned about the negative consequence of opportunism on trust. We discuss implications for theory, public policy, and macromarketing practice, and suggest options for future research."

Further, the study investigates the moderating effect of work-life balance on the relationship between career commitment and career success. By analyzing data from 360 middle level working employees, our empirical results show that career commitment has a positive and significant effect on the objective and subjective career success of employees. Work-life balance positively moderates the relationship between career commitment and subjective career success, whereas it fails to moderate the relationship between career commitment and objective career success. The study contributes by providing a better understanding of the employee’s perception of career commitment and career success and their management in emerging markets. Avenues for future research are identified."

Employing 181 manufacturer–customer relationships, we test the mediating effect of customer cooperation on the process and managerial innovations. As proposed, customer cooperation positively mediates the relationship between top management commitment and process innovation. However, customer cooperation fails to mediate the relationship between top management commitment and managerial innovation. The findings suggest that the magnitude of customer cooperation increases the adoption of green innovations between supply chain partners to mitigate the negative impact on the environment. Furthermore, customer cooperation enforces a sense of mutuality between supply chain partners to diminish the impact of carbon footprint."

      "en": "This chapter objective is to provide a broad understanding of the role and impact of green innovations and green practices in green supply chains. Green supply chains are an extension of ordinary supply chains. Green innovations and green practices function as key antecedents in transforming an ordinary supply chain into a green supply chain. Effective green supply chains apply a coordinated triple bottom-line (TBL) approach to simultaneously realize environmental, economic, and social goals in supply chain operations. External and internal factors play an instrumental role in the adoption of green innovations and green practices in supply chains’ operations. Some of the factors are changing consumer demand, government regulations and institutional pressures, technological innovations, and stakeholders’ attitude toward long-term environment sustainability. A review of green supply chain management literature shows that when businesses integrate green innovations and green practices in their supply chains, they achieve encouraging triple bottom-line outcomes. Transparency and truthful compliance to green innovations and practices in supply chain operations are some of the biggest challenges in green supply chains."

This study examines green innovation practices as determinants of the triple bottom line performance. Moreover, the study implicates top management commitment to sustainability as a driver of green managerial and process innovation. The research employs AMOS to assess survey-based data collected from 181 Turkish manufacturers. The results offer evidence that top management commitment fosters green innovation practices, and these innovations enhance economic performance, environmental performance, and customer cooperation. Top management should therefore commit to achieving sustainable operations and follow up this commitment with green innovations that drive triple bottom line performance."

      "en": "One objective for countries in the European common market is to optimize the performance of their multimodal logistics chains. The attainment of this goal requires the continuous development of container ports' performance, better customer satisfaction and - at the same time - to deter the occurrence of waste and bottleneck. Many regions in Europe are shifting from a single-port to a multi-port gateway situation; their ports frequently have overlapping hinterlands and are therefore increasingly facing competition and rivalry between each other. This paper examines container ports located in six countries: Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and the UK. It focuses on sensitivities to the inclusion of country-specific measurements on logistics service delivery performance outcomes on port efficiency. Port efficiency is measured with Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). The results suggest that: (1) efficiency measurements for Danish, Finnish, Swedish and British ports are heavily influenced by whether logistics service delivery outcomes are included or not; (2) Icelandic and Norwegian ports appear to be not sensitive to whether logistics service delivery outcomes are included or not; (3) on average, the container ports located in countries that are directly called by deep-sea transcontinental container liners are over-performers and under-performers with regard to technical efficiency and scale efficiency, respectively. We further apply a second-stage regression analysis to explain the impact of country-specific contextual factors on DEA-based efficiency scores."

This study concentrates on international ship-owners’ role and influence, in connection to environmental and safety conditions in ship recycling. The paper aims to find out how the ship recycling industry works today, and how it can be transformed into a sustainable industry in the future. The research strategy adopted is a qualitative exploratory case study approach, based on data collected from a literature search, relevant document analysis and semi-structured interviews of some industry players in Norway. The findings indicate that among the shipping companies in Norway, demolition practices vary. Best practice, according to data collected from shipping managers, is to avoid beaching. The interviewed Norwegian shipping managers claim they monitor the entire recycling at site, from the very beginning to the end. According to these ship managers, the recycling yards in the subcontinents need to be standardized if this industry is to become sustainable in the future. The standardization is possible only through increased investments, i.e. in workers’ training, welfare, equipment and infrastructure."

The research findings demonstrate that in the combine presence of manufacturing complexity and supplier held specific assets leads to higher inter-firm coordination that is crucial for achieving order compliance. Moreover, the results indicate that inter-firm coordination is highly effective in mitigating the prospect of opportunistic behaviour in international procurement relationships. By describing the vital procedural techniques and aesthetic features that are involved in manufacturing a textile fabric order, this study provides valuable insights about manufacturing complexity. Further, the empirical findings demonstrate that international buyers need closer coordination with their key suppliers to mitigate performance ambiguity regarding order compliance of complex customized products.\r\nKeywords: manufacturing complexity; textile fabric; inter-firm coordination; turnkey suppliers; buyer-manufacturer relationships; order compliance; textile products."

      "en": "This study examines the effect of market knowledge and specific assets on formal contracting in international exporting relationships. Market knowledge refers to the familiarity with the way foreign markets function. A sample of 131 international buyer-supplier relationships is the\r\nbasis for the empirical analysis. When market knowledge is low or modest, there is a positive association between specific assets and formal contracting because low market knowledge enforces the problem of asymmetric information and perceived opportunism with successive comprehensive formal contracting. When substantial asset specificity is combined with high market knowledge, the need for formal contracting diminishes because better market knowledge facilitates in lowering transactional uncertainties and exchange hazards and enforces trust building that attenuate the need for comprehensive formal contracting.

Relationship history and relational norms have become significant factors for explaining the scope and stability of purchasing relationships (Dwyer et al., 1987; Sweeney and Webb, 2002; Liu et al., 2009). Relationship duration facilitate in developing a combination of behavioural components, contractual arrangement and trust that overcome organisation problems in inter-firm businesses and it offers an opportunity to ensure stability, and comparative advantages for the procurement partners. The authors explore how the prior length of an inter-firm relationship helps in handling problems associated to behavioural uncertainty, opportunism and ex post transaction costs. The findings highlight the critical role of the prior length of business relationships and how it can help in attenuating organisation problems in procurement relationships. This study supports that relationship duration is a significant antecedent in overcoming organisational difficulties in business relationships and also enhancing relationship quality."

      "en": "The marketing literature acknowledges the importance of relationship duration and interpersonal relationships. Macneil's (1980) relational exchange theory indicates that relationship duration facilitates in developing relational norms i.e. verbal and non-verbal credible commitments, supporting a balanced governance mechanism between exchange partners. Ring and Van de Ven (1994) explained that relationship duration could affect interfirm governance or interorganizational relationships (IORs). Based onstudies conducted in the sphere of transaction cost, relational exchange and social exchange theories, the authors analyze how relationship duration influences the implementation of governance forms in the relationship maintenance period of business-to-business relationships. The presence of complexity (Porter, 1985) in buyer-supplier relationships cultivates uncertainty, opportunism and ex post transaction costs. Logistic partners in order to ensure the reliability and dependability of a supply chain use managerial and behavioral components. Business partners marginalized these relational hindrances through relational norms, formal and informal contracts and trust. Business relationship duration also encourage business partners to consolidate the antecedents for relationship duration. Empirical work shows that relational governance is associated with trust and that it improves the performance of interorganizational exchange (Heide and John, 1990). This article explores the association between opportunism, ex post transaction cost, behavioral uncertainty and relationship duration and proposes three research propositions."

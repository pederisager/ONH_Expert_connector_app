    "en": "Background: Interprofessional experience is vitally important for nutrition students, as nutritionists oen find themselves working independently in a team with other professionals. Few studies have explored qualitatively how nutrition students perceive learning activities in an interprofessional setting. Methods and Findings: ird-year bachelor’s degree nutrition students participated in a focus group interview aer interprofessional learning in a nursing home. A qualitative study with a phenomenological-hermeneutical approach was conducted to investigate lived experiences. One theme emerged from the data analysis: A professional understanding of oneself and others. Being acknowledged as a professional, being an active participant, and collaborating to enhance resident care were revealed as sub-themes. Conclusions: A short period of interprofessional learning in an authentic setting may expand students’ experiences and enhance professional confidence."

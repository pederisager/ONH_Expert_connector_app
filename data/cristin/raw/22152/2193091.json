    "en": "The purpose of this article is to examine the normative and institutional\r\nconstraints that exist within the Inter-Governmental Authority on\r\nDevelopment's (IGAD) peace and security frameworks. Despite IGAD's\r\nbroad mandate to maintain regional peace and security in the Horn of\r\nAfrica, this article claims that the organisation has yet to develop a\r\ncomprehensive regional peace and security framework. As a result, the\r\ncontribution of IGAD has been limited. Meanwhile, the region remains one\r\nof the most conflict-ridden in Africa. In this study, a qualitative research\r\napproach was used. Primary and secondary data were gathered through indepth interviews, newspaper articles, and online resources. The data was\r\ninvestigated using qualitative discourse analysis and content analysis. The\r\nfindings indicate that IGAD lacks robust and comprehensive normative and\r\ninstitutional mechanisms for effectively maintaining regional stability."

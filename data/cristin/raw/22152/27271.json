    "en": "This study is an ethnographic account which explores the social organization of an Eritrean highland community and the livelihood of the peasants from the Tigrinya-speaking group. The kinship system of the highlands, an agnatic lineage system, is examined in detail. Analysis shows that it interlinks the individuals and the villages of the highlands into an intricate web of kinship. The lineage system (gezauti) defines, among other factors, a from of social hierarchy and the entitlement of access to land in the particular villages. The book also explores the communal land tenure system of the highlands, called meret shehena. The study concludes that the system of kinship and land tenure in highland Eritrea have provided for the social and cultural survival of the peasantry even during the disintegrating influences of famine and war."

    "en": "Zanzibari social relations were long characterised by disruption and antagonism\r\naround election time, between followers of the incumbent Chama Cha Mapinduzi\r\n(CCM) and opposition party Civic United Front (CUF). In November 2009, with a\r\ntop-level political meeting between the leaders of CUF and CCM, this started to\r\nchange. Based on field interviews and observations, this article argues that Zanzibari\r\npolitics – over the period from July 2009 to November 2010 – moved from a hostile\r\nand polarised political environment, via a limbo period, to a widely supported\r\nreconciliation process, and that over these three phases, intergroup relations changed.\r\nUsing social identity theory, we argue that the shared Zanzibari identity increased in\r\nsalience, and intergroup animosity decreased, a process likened to the social\r\npsychological dual recategorisation. Second, reasons for this change in intergroup\r\nrelations are discussed, comparing this recent process to former failed peace processes,\r\nstressing shared goals, intergroup communalities, leadership dialogue and cooperation,\r\nand focus on the superordinate identity. The material demonstrates that elite-led\r\npolitical discourse can increase or decrease political tension and thus initiate social\r\nidentity transformation. We argue that this process further created room for the\r\npeaceful 2010 elections and the establishment of the current Zanzibar Government of\r\nNational Unity."

    "en": "More and more machines with artificial intelligence (AI) take over tasks in everyday life. The use of machines and AI is often appealing to managers. Thus, it is vital to managers to know how to use artificial intelligence and machines to execute business tasks. However, experts in AI warned about the negative consequences that might occur by wrong use of those technologies. Some even created dystopias of human extinction based on AI. We, therefore, conclude that despite technical and economic considerations also ethical considerations are necessary for the sustainable use of AI and related technologies. Our proposal aims at describing the outline of a conceptual paper developing an ethical management framework for artificial intelligence that is targeted at the interface of management academics and practitioners."

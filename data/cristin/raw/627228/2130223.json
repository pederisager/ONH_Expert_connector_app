    "en": "Digitalization is a macro-trend affecting every sector, albeit in different ways. We study the process of digitalization of the public mental care system, by analyzing the case of the introduction of a new digital technology, \r\nBraive, within two Norwegian mental care clinics. Despite positive initial attitudes among the employees, we find that, absent effective managerial and organizational support, professional care providers will effectively resist the \r\nadoption of new technologies. Managers need to ensure that professional concerns are heard and integrated within the adoption process, if they intend to reap the potential rewards that digitalization offers for the medical care field."

The study included 128 patients [68 in a study group - with acute coronary syndrome (ACS-group), 60 in a control group - no changes in coronary vessels detected by coronary angiography (H-group)]. A detailed clinical dental examination was performed. The following symptoms of periodontal pathologies were assessed: gingival bleeding, tooth mobility, gingival swelling, changes in gingival colour, a burning sensation in the oral mucosa, the presence of pus, and the need for antibiotic therapy. Moreover, the patients’ oral health was assessed on the basis of the following dental indices [Plaque Index (PlI), Approximal Plaque Index (API)], their periodontal health on the basis of the following indices [Gingival Index (GI), Community Periodontal Index of Treatment Needs  (CPITN)], and their dental  health on the basis of the following components of the DMF-T index:  (D-T) - decayed, missing and filled teeth, (F-T) - filled teeth and (M-T) - missing teeth. \r\nResults: oral health in the study group was worse to a degree that was statistically significant in all the indices examined, excluding the filled teeth index (F-T), where there was no statistical significance compared to the control group. \r\nConclusion: The oral health of patients from the ACS group was significantly worse compared to the H-group. \r\n"

      "en": "The possible connection between oral health and overall health has been a subject of debate among medical practitioners and theoreticians for millenia.\r\n\r\nAIM:\r\nThe aim of the study was to determine the frequency of bacterial or fungal mouth infections in myocardial infarction patients treated with primary coronary intervention.\r\n\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\r\nA total of 128 patients took part in the study (68 patients in the study group and 60 in the control group). The medical histories of the patients were taken, and the following tests were performed: a physical examination and an oral hygiene assessment. The oral hygiene assessment included a mycological evaluation of the oral cavity and bacteriological and mycological analyses of samples taken from gingival pockets.\r\n\r\nRESULTS:\r\nFungal colonisation of the oral cavity was more prevalent in the study group than in the control group - 33 (50.0 %) vs 15 (25.0 %) p < 0.05. No statistically significant differences between the study and control groups were noted in terms of the number of positive bacteriological cultures. When it comes to predictors of myocardial infarction, fungal infections in the oral cavity were deemed to be a significant prognostic factor (OR 3.0). No similar correlation was identified in the case of bacterial infections.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nThe study results suggest that poor oral health may be one of the predisposing factors for ischaemic heart disease, including in its acute form, i.e. myocardial infarction."

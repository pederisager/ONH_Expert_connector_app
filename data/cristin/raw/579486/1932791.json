    "en": "As the world has gained interest in the climatic, economic and political\r\ndevelopments in the Arctic over the last decade, the role of Nordic\r\ncountries in regional and European security affairs has also been on the\r\nlimelight. Some have taken the opportunity to argue that this should lead\r\nNordic countries1—Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden—to\r\ncloser cooperation, even integration. The increased tension with the\r\nRussian Federation from 2014 onwards has only made this argument\r\nmore apparent, as the Nordics attempt to safeguard their multi-track\r\napproach to Russia, including both dialogue and deterrence at the same\r\ntime.\r\nSeen from afar, Nordic countries tend to look rather similar—\r\nsmall, highly developed democracies with a strong welfare state, market\r\nliberalism, a shared and overlapping history and, apart from Finland, a\r\ncommon language family. However, when we look more closely at these\r\ncountries, their security concerns and their approaches to the Arctic,\r\ndifferences stand out."

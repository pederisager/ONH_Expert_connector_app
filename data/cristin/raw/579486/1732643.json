    "en": "Why do states engage in disputes over who owns what at sea? How do states delineate such ownership and rights? What does this tell us about international politics concerning the ocean? These are the core questions examined in this doctoral thesis, which sets out to show why states settle their maritime boundary disputes. Boundaries in the ocean are man-made constructs of importance to everything from oil and gas production, to fisheries and environmental protection. Understanding what leads states to agree in ongoing disputes, when more than half of all boundaries at sea remain unresolved today, can say something about the international relations of ocean politics. Drawing on political science and international law, this thesis shows why we need understand the interplay between security politics, legal considerations and domestic interests in order to understand what motivates states to settle maritime disputes."

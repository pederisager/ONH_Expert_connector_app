  "summary": {
    "en": "Ever since the European Union (EU) became actively engaged in Arctic affairs, its relationship with Norway - as its immediate Arctic/northern neighbour - can be characterised as paradoxical. Although Norway has pro-actively worked to get the EU more involved in Arctic governance issues, it has, from the European Commission’s first Communication on Arctic issues in 2008, been sceptical of various policy and legal steps taken by the EU. Chapter 5 investigates the complex and ambiguous relationship between Norway and the EU."

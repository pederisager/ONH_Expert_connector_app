    "en": "Background:  Norway  is  lacking  a  population-based  national  monitoring  program  for  iodine,  sodium,  and  vitamin D status.Objective: The aim of  this study was to pilot-test a study design for collecting biological samples from a coun-try-representative sample of  2-year-old children and their mothers and to report results for iodine, salt, and vitamin D at baseline, before initiation of  salt iodization in Norway.Design: In a cross-sectional study, we recruited 2-year-old children and their mothers during the routine 2-year check-up through 38 randomly selected health clinics in 2021. Spot urine samples were analyzed for iodine, creatinine,  and  sodium,  and  dried  blood  spots  from  the  mothers  were  analyzed  for  thyroglobulin  (Tg)  and  25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D).Results:  We  aimed  at  including  400  mother–child  pairs  but  recruited  only  55  pairs.  Major  challenges  were  closed health clinics due to the COVID-19 pandemic, lack of  motivation of  the health personnel to prioritize recruiting,  missing  information  about  non-participation,  and  high  workload  for  participants.  The  median  urinary iodine concentration (UIC) was 123 (95% CI: 76, 228) μg/L in the toddlers and 83 (95% CI: 72, 99) μg/L in the mothers. The median urinary sodium concentration (UNaC) was 62 (95% CI: 37, 91) mmol/L in the toddlers and 93 (95% CI: 77, 107) mmol/L in the mothers. Of  the mothers, 18% had levels of  25(OH)D <50 nmol/L (suboptimal status).Discussion and conclusion: Lessons learned from the pilot study will be used to design a national monitoring program for toddlers and women of  childbearing age in Norway. The results indicate that 2-year-old children and women of  childbearing age in Norway may have inadequate iodine intakes at the group level, while for vitamin D, most of  the mothers had adequate status."

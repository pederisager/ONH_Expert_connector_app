    "en": "Objective: To investigate whether food literacy competencies and diet quality vary\r\nbetween 16-to-24-year-olds vegans, lacto-ovo vegetarians, pescatarians, flexitarians and omnivores and to assess whether food literacy is associated with diet\r\nquality.\r\nDesign: Cross-sectional study. Food literacy (general nutrition knowledge, critical\r\nnutrition literacy and food skills) and diet quality were measured using an\r\nelectronic questionnaire.\r\nSetting: Southern Norway, September 2021 – March 2022.\r\nParticipants: Healthy 16–24-year-olds (n 165).\r\nResults: Overall, the mean general nutrition knowledge score was moderate (48·0\r\nout of 67·0); the lowest mean score was found in omnivores and the highest in\r\nflexitarians (45·6 v. 51·5) (P = 0·034). The mean score of critical nutrition literacy\r\nwas also moderate (3·7 out of 5·0); vegans showed higher scores compared to\r\nother dietary practices (P = 0·018). No difference was observed in food skills\r\nbetween the different dietary practices. The overall median diet quality score was\r\n46·0 out of 80·0, lowest in omnivores and highest in vegans (42·0 v. 56·0)\r\n(P =< 0·001). In multivariate regression analyses, general nutrition knowledge,\r\nfood skills and vegan dietary practice were significantly associated with higher diet\r\nquality.\r\nConclusions: We found moderate levels of food literacy across all dietary practices.\r\nThe food literacy competencies, general nutrition knowledge and food skills were\r\nassociated with higher diet quality in our sample. Omnivores showed both the\r\nlowest general nutrition knowledge level and lowest diet quality scores. In\r\ncontrast, both flexitarians and vegans scored highest on general nutrition\r\nknowledge and diet quality scores, despite being one of the less restrictive and\r\none of the strictest plant-based dietary practices, respectively."
